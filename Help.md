## Tips
This site supports **full text search**. For example, if you're not able to remember a particular detail about an NPC, you can begin to type their name in the search box at the top of the page, and you will see results for that character and quickly pull up relevant information!
## F.A.Q.
To be fair there aren't really any "frequently asked questions" as much as I'm trying to predict questions you may have. If you think of anything else not in this list, let me know and I can add it.

### Q: How do I submit a note to be added to the wiki?
There are many different ways. We can decide as a group on a "standard" way of doing it where you guys take advantage of a shared google drive or similar to upload your .md files to. 
However, feel free to share your notes with me through discord (just drag and drop the file into chat) or email them to me at lukascparsons@gmail.com.
### Q: Is this mandatory? / Why should I bother?
No, it is not mandatory for you to write notes and submit them to me for the purposes of displaying here. The reason I made this site was so that I could easily share content with you in an aesthetically pleasing way, and because I wanted a Campaign log and I didn't like any "out of the box" solutions available online. **The point is**, this can be as relevant or irrelevant as you wish it to be. I will continue to use it as a campaign log, but it is up to the party if you wish to interact with it further and allocate notes here. I think it would be an excellent resource, but primarily I think it would build a sense of achievement and progression  as you watch your notes and adventures grow here.
