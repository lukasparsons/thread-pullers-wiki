# Naxene Drathkala's Quest
Every bone in her body tells Naxene that the attack on Goldenfields is just the beginning. She’s heard “rumblings” that other settlements have been impacted by the sudden appearance of giants — and not just hill giants but also stone, frost, fire, and cloud giants. Naxene is convinced that now is not the time for half-measures. She has read books about the ancient conflict between dragons and giants, and she urges the characters to seek out a powerful good dragon, convince it to contact other good dragons, and use them to combat the giants.

She recommends that the party speak with an acquaintance of hers - a "dragon expert" in **Waterdeep** named **Chazlauth Yarghorn**.
