# Oren Yogilvy's Quest

Oren is spooked by rumors that giants are rampaging throughout the North. He asks the characters if they could check on his sister, Lily, who works at the **Happy Cow Tavern** in **Daggerford**. He also wants them to deliver a hastily written letter to Lily that tells her heâ€™s doing fine, and would she please send him some more money.
