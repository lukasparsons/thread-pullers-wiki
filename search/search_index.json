For example, if you\u2019re not able to remember a particular detail about an NPC, you can begin to type their name in the search box at the top of the page, and you will see results for that character and quickly pull up relevant information! There is a Dark Mode if you are so incined (which I very much prefer). If you wish to use it, simply click the little toggle switch at the top of the page to change to dark mode. F.A.Q. \u00b6 To be fair there aren\u2019t really any \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d as much as I\u2019m trying to predict questions you may have. If you think of anything else not in this list, let me know and I can add it. Q: How do I submit a note to be added to the wiki? \u00b6 There are many different ways. We can decide as a group on a \u201cstandard\u201d way of doing it where you guys take advantage of a shared google drive or similar to upload your .md files to. However, feel free to share your notes with me through discord (just drag and drop the file into chat) or email them to me at lukascparsons@gmail.com . Q: What is markdown? \u00b6 Markdown is simple once you use it a little bit. Simply put, it is a way of taking notes that makes them automatically look aesthetically pleasing and structured. I\u2019m using it right now! I\u2019ll provide a couple examples: # This is a heading ## This is a smaller heading (you can keep going up until ######) **This is bold!** *This is italic* - This is a bullet point These are really all you need to know in order to get rolling making some awesome stuff. All you really need to get started is the Markdown Cheatsheet but if you want to take a more in-depth look at markdown, you can have a look at MarkdownGuide.org and really dig in. Q: How do I write a \u201c.md\u201d file? \u00b6 The best way to write a markdown(.md) file is to use an editor that can show you the results of your markdown in real time! An excellent option is dillinger.io . But in reality, you could open up a new document in notepad, and as long there aren\u2019t any errors with your markdown, it will work and look great once it is loaded into the site! Pretty cool stuff. Q: Is this mandatory? / Why should I bother? \u00b6 No, it is not mandatory for you to write notes and submit them to me for the purposes of displaying here. The reason I made this site was so that I could easily share content with you in an aesthetically pleasing way, and because I wanted a Campaign log and I didn\u2019t like any \u201cout of the box\u201d solutions available online. The point is , this can be as relevant or irrelevant as you wish it to be. I will continue to use it as a campaign log, but it is up to the party if you wish to interact with it further and allocate notes here. I think it would be an excellent resource, but primarily I think it would build a sense of achievement and progression as you watch your notes and adventures grow here.

Inside it read: My darling Xilriah, not a day goes by that I don\u2019t miss your warmth, your beauty, your wisdom. It has been so difficult without you by my side. I am doing my best to raise the beautiful children you blessed me with. When you gifted me this book to celebrate the conception of our 8th son, I was so excited to fill its pages with our adventures and the long life we would spend together. You were meant to outlive me, and I\u2019m so sorry that my love became the reason for your downfall. When your people sent messengers with gifts for our good news and invited you to a celebration ceremony as is your people\u2019s tradition, I was so thankful for the restoration that was occurring between you and your family. I wish I could go back and beg you not to go. Those cowards. Those fucking animals. How could they They were against us from the start. I know you gave away everything to be by my side, and they didn\u2019t value your sacrifice, but saw it as an affront to their tradition. They feigned acceptance and invited you back into their fold only to stab you in the back and leave you cold at my doorstep. At first, I was thankful they at least brought you back to me, but then I remembered the stories you told me of how when a member of your family died you were meant to be buried next to the largest oak in their forest as is their tradition and ceremony. I thought we were blessed by the gods and chosen by them. But they have forsaken us. I am striking the prophecy from our family history. I\u2019ve already sold the relic to the highest bidder. They weren\u2019t here when we needed them, so why should my descendants follow them blindly? I know you wouldn\u2019t approve, but this is the only way I will be able to rest in peace. Knowing my family can live on, free to make their own choices and not counting down the days until a prophecy is fulfilled. The boys are old enough now to tend to the homestead. I spend my days here, with you, making your new home more beautiful. I know it isn\u2019t much now, but before my time here is done, this will be a place I will be proud to lay my head with you for eternity. I planted an oak tree atop this mound, and I hope it takes root. I am so much older than when you last saw me my love, and I feel my time running out. I\u2019m sorry I never had the courage to fill this book with more words. I didn\u2019t think you would want to hear how difficult things were with you gone. I didn\u2019t foresee the bigotry and prejudice that would be thrust upon our children\u2019s shoulders, and I have done my best to be here for them, but you were always better with those things, you know. Your children are beautiful and full of life. And they will live lives of joy and peace without the weight of expectation and divine responsibility. I will be with you soon my love, I feel my time is short.

Apparitions of Aabjorn and Xilriah appeared to Ti and offered to augment the fox\u2019s power with their essence. Ti, not wanting to leave the tomb without protection from future invaders, sacrificed a piece of his vitality in the form of his arm, to bless the tomb and maintain the divine warding around the tomb and hopefully prevent the souls at rest there from being disturbed again in the future. However, upon returning to the Bronsson home for some much needed rest, the party discovered that Ti\u2019s father had been kidnapped by the Shadowy Figure while they were dealing with the monstrosity in the tomb. Gwen recounts that the figure along with an old man in dark robes entered the home and demanded to know where \u201cthe artifact\u201d was and did\u2019t believe Piotyr when he claimed to have no idea what they could be referring to. The two invaders took Piotyr and disappeared into the night. The party collapsed, exhausted, with plans to take Ti\u2019s mother to Goldenfields to reunite with her twin sons and Ti\u2019s brothers, Steven and Gah Bronsson.","title":"Session 10: Cleansing the Tomb"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%2010/#session-10-cleansing-the-tomb","text":"The party deftly avoided the magic circles in the tomb while dodging attacks from the deceased Bronsson ancestors, and landed blow after blow against the hideous flesh monster.

When your people sent messengers with gifts for our good news and invited you to a celebration ceremony as is your people\u2019s tradition, I was so thankful for the restoration that was occurring between you and your family. I wish I could go back and beg you not to go. Those cowards. Those fucking animals. How could they They were against us from the start. I know you gave away everything to be by my side, and they didn\u2019t value your sacrifice, but saw it as an affront to their tradition. They feigned acceptance and invited you back into their fold only to stab you in the back and leave you cold at my doorstep. At first, I was thankful they at least brought you back to me, but then I remembered the stories you told me of how when a member of your family died you were meant to be buried next to the largest oak in their forest as is their tradition and ceremony. I thought we were blessed by the gods and chosen by them. But they have forsaken us. I am striking the prophecy from our family history. I\u2019ve already sold the relic to the highest bidder. They weren\u2019t here when we needed them, so why should my descendants follow them blindly? I know you wouldn\u2019t approve, but this is the only way I will be able to rest in peace. Knowing my family can live on, free to make their own choices and not counting down the days until a prophecy is fulfilled. The boys are old enough now to tend to the homestead. I spend my days here, with you, making your new home more beautiful. I know it isn\u2019t much now, but before my time here is done, this will be a place I will be proud to lay my head with you for eternity. I planted an oak tree atop this mound, and I hope it takes root. I am so much older than when you last saw me my love, and I feel my time running out. I\u2019m sorry I never had the courage to fill this book with more words. I didn\u2019t think you would want to hear how difficult things were with you gone. I didn\u2019t foresee the bigotry and prejudice that would be thrust upon our children\u2019s shoulders, and I have done my best to be here for them, but you were always better with those things, you know. Your children are beautiful and full of life. And they will live lives of joy and peace without the weight of expectation and divine responsibility. I will be with you soon my love, I feel my time is short. I pray that when I see you next, you see me as you did when we were young and in love and not as the old and bitter man I have become, Forever yours, Aabjorn Bronsson After this, the fox walked into the center of the room and began to glow and levitate. Apparitions of Aabjorn and Xilriah appeared to Ti and offered to augment the fox\u2019s power with their essence. Ti, not wanting to leave the tomb without protection from future invaders, sacrificed a piece of his vitality in the form of his arm, to bless the tomb and maintain the divine warding around the tomb and hopefully prevent the souls at rest there from being disturbed again in the future. However, upon returning to the Bronsson home for some much needed rest, the party discovered that Ti\u2019s father had been kidnapped by the Shadowy Figure while they were dealing with the monstrosity in the tomb. Gwen recounts that the figure along with an old man in dark robes entered the home and demanded to know where \u201cthe artifact\u201d was and did\u2019t believe Piotyr when he claimed to have no idea what they could be referring to. The two invaders took Piotyr and disappeared into the night. The party collapsed, exhausted, with plans to take Ti\u2019s mother to Goldenfields to reunite with her twin sons and Ti\u2019s brothers, Steven and Gah Bronsson.","title":"Session 10: Cleansing the Tomb"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%2011/","text":"Session 11: To Goldenfields! \u00b6 Previously, after purging the Bronsson tomb of the evil that had penetrated its defenses, you made your way back to the Bronsson home, only to find it ransacked with Ti\u2019s mother hiding in a secret room under the stairs.

You see yourself, your hands in front of you, but nothing else. Suddenly you are overwhelmed with the feeling of falling, but unlike typical dreams, you do not wake from this sensation. The panic begins to set in as you see a great plain begin to stretch out before you. Lit by what you now realize is a faint starlight above your head. Falling for a hundred, a hundred-fifty, two-hundred feet, the ground fast-approaching, suddenly, you are no longer moving. You see this great plain stretch out what seems to be infinitely in all directions before you. The plain begins to move and twist and it looks like gigantic creatures are crawling beneath it and bending it into interesting shapes and features. The plain begins to bend on the edges outside of your view, and you realize that you are suddenly confronted with a view of the world from a bird\u2019s eye view. You are floating a few hundred feet above Nightstone. You can now make out the landmarks beneath you as they take form under the tectonic shifting of the plain. You look up and the sky begins to swirl and dark black clouds form in the air above you, blocking out most of the night sky. After this, stones the size of houses begin falling from the cloud and destroying the plain beneath you. You brace for their impact but you hear nothing, feel no vibrations. You only see the devastation unfold. You look to the east and see tall slender giants. Their physical size incomprehensible to you they could level towns with a footstep. You see them climbing down from mountains far off in the distance like titanic spiders. You look to the west and off the coast you see a storm the likes of which you\u2019ve never seen with semi-constant lighting strikes slamming into the ocean, and in the darkness beneath them you see more humanoid silhouettes in the shadows of the storm. You look to the north and more gigantic humanoid shapes jumping down from cliff-tops and charging forward. With each step, the grounds beneath them freeze over, and they leave blizzards in their wake. The hills around you begin to move and you realize they aren\u2019t hills at all, but more leviathan-sized creatures, round and grotesque with fat, rolling around on the ground laying waste to forests and towns. Then you see the plain split open beneath you, and the plain is lit up with a glow of fire and magma from the newly created fissure. You look straight down into it and huge glowing red eyes stare back at you from the void, as two gigantic hands reach out and clasp the sides of this canyon with ease and begin to pull itself forward and out from its hiding place. You feel overwhelmed with panic. The giants\u2019 movements begin stirring up all matter of monsters and creatures from their dens and hovels and setting them loose on the world, you find yourself in disbelief at the destruction taking place before you and you know in your soul that there is no way for you to stop it, as a giant winged creature flies overhead and its cry is the only thing you have heard since this terrible dream began. As you feel the helplessness close in around you, you look down and see the spirit, the small fox floating just before your chest. It looks to you, and you feel a sense of purpose and renewed strength. It turns its back to you and becomes a floating ball of divine energy, piercing through the darkness. It is hard to look at now. It shoots off with a flash, it runs to the north into a cliff-side not far from Nightstone, flies out, and begins to zip at faster than lightning speeds from one corner of the continent to another. At one moment you catch it flying straight towards the region where your home is found before stopping momentarily, turning on a dime, and continuing its pattern. Each time the spirit makes a sharp turn, the light grows brighter and brighter. Finally, it flies straight toward the forests that run through the heart of Faerun and it disappears into the dark interior, but you can see the underglow it is providing to the trees flashing about like brilliant torchlight beneath the branches. The light grows and grows in brightness and radiance until you can\u2019t look directly at it anymore. It occupies your perspective and all the other parts of the plain beneath you are bathed in the light. As it consumes the entirety of your vision and you see nothing but blinding white light, you hear a deep growl and a snarl of a tremendous creature, and you snap awake. Kella was standing over you with a familiar green, winged serpent wrapped around her shoulders, letting you know that you have company. An orc tribe, forced into retreat from a previous battle within Ardeep Forest to the north are now looking for shelter and the mostly-abandoned village is ripe for the taking. You fought alongside the Zhentarim and were able to protect Nightstone, killing the injured Orc chief and their shaman, forcing the surviving orcs to flee. After the battle, Resolute restored the guard, Alara, that had fallen, and noted that many of the fallen orcs had been wearing necklaces made from the ears of elves. The party began to discuss what steps they would take next and decided that they needed to save the people of Nightstone from the caves as soon as possible.","title":"Session 3: The Battle of Nightstone"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%203/#session-3-the-battle-of-nightstone","text":"During his sleep, Ti experiences a strange dream: Ti, you find yourself swimming in a sea of black. You see yourself, your hands in front of you, but nothing else. Suddenly you are overwhelmed with the feeling of falling, but unlike typical dreams, you do not wake from this sensation. The panic begins to set in as you see a great plain begin to stretch out before you. Lit by what you now realize is a faint starlight above your head. Falling for a hundred, a hundred-fifty, two-hundred feet, the ground fast-approaching, suddenly, you are no longer moving. You see this great plain stretch out what seems to be infinitely in all directions before you. The plain begins to move and twist and it looks like gigantic creatures are crawling beneath it and bending it into interesting shapes and features. The plain begins to bend on the edges outside of your view, and you realize that you are suddenly confronted with a view of the world from a bird\u2019s eye view. You are floating a few hundred feet above Nightstone. You can now make out the landmarks beneath you as they take form under the tectonic shifting of the plain. You look up and the sky begins to swirl and dark black clouds form in the air above you, blocking out most of the night sky. After this, stones the size of houses begin falling from the cloud and destroying the plain beneath you. You brace for their impact but you hear nothing, feel no vibrations. You only see the devastation unfold. You look to the east and see tall slender giants. Their physical size incomprehensible to you they could level towns with a footstep. You see them climbing down from mountains far off in the distance like titanic spiders. You look to the west and off the coast you see a storm the likes of which you\u2019ve never seen with semi-constant lighting strikes slamming into the ocean, and in the darkness beneath them you see more humanoid silhouettes in the shadows of the storm. You look to the north and more gigantic humanoid shapes jumping down from cliff-tops and charging forward. With each step, the grounds beneath them freeze over, and they leave blizzards in their wake. The hills around you begin to move and you realize they aren\u2019t hills at all, but more leviathan-sized creatures, round and grotesque with fat, rolling around on the ground laying waste to forests and towns. Then you see the plain split open beneath you, and the plain is lit up with a glow of fire and magma from the newly created fissure. You look straight down into it and huge glowing red eyes stare back at you from the void, as two gigantic hands reach out and clasp the sides of this canyon with ease and begin to pull itself forward and out from its hiding place.
