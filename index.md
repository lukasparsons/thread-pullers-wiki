# Welcome, Thread-Pullers
This is the wiki for our SKT Campaign. Here you will see several things:
- Adventure Log
- NPC information
- Location Information
- Item Information
- Character Information
- Whatever the hell else you guys decide you want to see.

Looking for Character Bios from everyone to post in their page.
- [ ] Haffyd

- [ ] Nethhala
- [ ] Corpus
- [ ] Ti
- [ ] Elias

>P.S. - I don't want to be the only one filling this wiki out. I will do my best to put info like Quests and Session Recaps on here consistently, but it would really bring me joy if you guys used this to compile the party's information on NPCs, Locations, Long-Term plans, Secrets and Clues you've uncovered, etc. Unfortunately I don't have a way to allow you to directly edit this website, but if there is a .md file for any subject you want notes on and it is in a shared location such as a google drive folder or similar, I will check that folder every Saturday between sessions and update the site to have the most recent versions before the next session. That way you can have the site pulled up on a tab or on your phone to reference during the game!
