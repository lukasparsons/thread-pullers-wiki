>[!info]- Delsephine's Story
> "If there's one thing the elves hate more than half-bloods, it's darkskinned half-bloods."
> My mother was a tavern maid at the Whispering Willow -- a dive-bar in Waterdeep. A fancy-pants elven nobleman, some diplomat who was far too rich and powerful to be spending time at such an establishment took a liking to my dear mum. 
> He knocked her up, and when he found out the bastard did everything he could to get her to rid herself of the baby. When my mum refused, he used his power and influence to pay some thugs to rob the Willow and place the stolen gold and liquor at my mum's place before informing the owner of the establishment that he saw some tavern wench fleeing with the items.
> My mum was across town in the market buying food with her sorry excuse of a wage. Lies travel faster than the truth in Waterdeep, some say the rats whisper to each other.
> Well, my mum heard on her way home that the law was looking for her, so she snuck out of the city that day with nothing but the food she had bought from the market that day. We lived with nothing.
> She died from some illness while we were living in a shack eating off of squirrels and berries before I was grown. I just left her there and wandered west to the ocean. I stowed away on a merchant ship hoping to be taken somewhere far away from the sword coast.
> Well that ship was plundered by some pirates who were quite fond of dragons, and I hid in a barrel of citrus and was taken aboard their ship. When they found me, I had been living in the barrel for a week and it was half-eaten. They took pity on me and I lived the next twenty five years on the sea.
> 
> They got me my own ship pretty quick once they saw how well I took to the life. I felt like everything had been taken from me by people with plenty, it felt real good to take from them. So they let me sail the seas to my heart's content as long as I paid a cut of my plunder to the cult of dragons.

>**How did you come to fly this ship?**
>I was minding my business manning my ship with my crew, and I received word from a wyrm that a job was required of me. I needed to deliver an airship to a group of adventurers in the north on behalf of the great dragon of the north -- Klauth.
>So here I am, I guess they thought the best sailor would be the best flyer as well! Hah!
