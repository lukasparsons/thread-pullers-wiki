Left within the tower with the remnants of the Wyvern, Harshnag quickly got to work dismembering the corpse of the beast and flinging the scraps onto the unknowing townsfolk of Triboar. After this was done, Nethhala used the **Speak with Dead** scroll she found within Zephyros's possessions to temporarily reanimate his corpse so that you could ask him some questions. 
Among the questions asked were how to get to your destination, how do you power the navigation orb, what does [[Zephyros]] know of the[[ Eye of the All Father]], Who is Baruda, and **did Zephyros remember having a conversation about eternal life with Adonis**. (yes... he did remember.)

The corpse of Zephyros informed you that the instructions for the orb could be found in his journal. Corpus and Ti made quick work of finding a hidden key in his bedchambers, and a locked drawer in his desk that the key went to. Within the drawer were a book, a quill, an inkwell, and some gold.

The ink had an enchantment on it that prevented anyone from seeing what was written until Resolute absolved the enchantment by casting Dispel Magic with Durandal. Within the tome you learned that you are missing an ingredient to power the orb, Cloud Lotus, that is only available in lush green areas below a certain temperature and is very rare. You also learned that you could optionally drain arcane energy from another power source of substantial capability. You now have a decision to make. Head into the Lurkwood in search of the Cloud Lotus, head northeast to the Shining White to see if that is where the mysterious compass points, or investigate the point of interest known as Griffon's Nest in Zephyros's journal.
