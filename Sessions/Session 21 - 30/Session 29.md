The forest hag and her undead children got clapped by the party. Ventis got penetrated by ghostly vines and turned into an undead plant monster along with the forest kiddos.

After the hag got clapped, her hut was burned down and the party grabbed a couple cloud lotus to power the tower of Zephyros.
