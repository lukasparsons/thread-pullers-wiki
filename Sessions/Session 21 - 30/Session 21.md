Session Data Missing for sessions 21-24. Summary of those sessions follow:

This was the period of time in which the party left [[Rassalantar]] with [[Harshnag]] after agreeing to assist him in his quest to discover the [[Eye of the All Father]]. The party witnessed the crash-landing of [[Zephyros]]'s Tower. After investigating the tower, the party defeated the stone gargoyles that had been responsible for killing Zephyros and causing his tower to crash.

During this combat, Adonis fell from the tower while Resolute was downed. 
While Resolute was downed:
- [[Haffyd]] attempted to reclaim [[Durandal]] from Resolute in order to free him from the influence of the Soul Prism, but the pact weapon could not be kept from Resolute.
- Resolute had an internal dialogue with [[Baruda]] while downed where Resolute relinquished control of his body for a short period of time in exchange for Baruda saving Adonis.

During the following sessions, the party investigated the tower, learning what they could about how it operated, deciphering Zephyros's notes, and learning about the events that led to his downfall.

- The party learned that they required more Cloud Lotus, a very rare fauna that only grows in very select conditions.
- The party learned that Zephryos had been consulting with entities of the planes and learned of the importance and location of The Eye of the All Father as well as the potential importance of a  Giant burial site known as [[Shining White]]
- Zephyros was chased away from the skies surrounding the Eye of the All Father by these stone gargoyles who pursued him relentlessly until they were able to catch him and bring the tower down.
- Zephyros had been on his way to the party when he was attacked.
