**Borrowing a Tower**  
After clearing the ruined rassalantar keep of cultists perscribing to the Cult of the Chain Breaker, and nearly stopping the priest Maokai from completing his ritual, you cleaned the basement of the keep and met the Blackstaff of Waterdeep, Vajra Saffar.  
Impressed by your heroics, she invited you back to Waterdeep where you would share what you had learned about the Ordning with the council there and perhaps further aid their efforts in combating the giant threat.

However, before she could regain her strength to teleport you back to Waterdeep, a giant by the name of Harshnag the Grim, weilding a giant axe that seems to radiate a constant chill of the north.  
Harshnag reported that Amphail had been attacked by giants who were drawn to the gathering of food for the Lord Roaringborn's nameday celebration. He tells Lady Blackstaff that he is heading off in search of The Eye of the All-Father immediately in search of answers to stop the shedding of blood.

The Eye of the All-Father was an ancient giant temple that was lost to the frozen wastes of the north as giant civilization declined in the time before man. Harshnag knows the general location as an ancestor of his had part in building the temple and stories of it have been passed down through his family.

Hesitant to attempt the journey alone, Harshnag floats the idea of the Thread-Pullers joining him on his quest north for answers. After accepting, Lady Blackstaff informs you that she will be waiting for you in Waterdeep.

Making your way north, you see a large cylinder falling from the heavens, and upon investigation you find the remains of Zephyros's tower, with the giant deceased within. Stone gargoyles come to life and attack the party, with two gargoyles fleeing out the window with a trunk seen within Zephyros's private quarters. After the fight and after stopping the escaping gargoyles, you find a chest containing the navigation orb for the tower and a compass. The compass does not seem to point north, and the navigation orb's function did not seem immediately clear.

After some troubleshooting, you discovered how to operate the navigation orb using Zephyros's golden staff. When the orb was placed within a brazier in the middle of a magic circle and the staff placed in a matching slot on the ground, the orb floated into the air and showed an aerial live-map of faerun. You were able to touch the orb and chart course, causing the tower to slowly rise and begin a new journey.

After a day of travel you are all rested and a new morning has come, and overnight Haffyd noticed that the glowing runes surrounding the navigation orb seemed to steadily dim throughout the course of the night.

The body of Zephyros still lies upon the floor, not quite beginning to smell, and the very much alive body of Harshnag lies in the atrium below, sleeping off the fight he experienced with another flock of gargoyles away from the tower.
