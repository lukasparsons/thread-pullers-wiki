**Death to the Uthgardt**

The party lands in an open field South of the Lurkwood, out of fuel.
They set to setting up a funeral pyre and giving final rites to their departed friend, Zephyros. The plumes of smoke draw the attention of a local band of **Uthgardt Barbarians**. 

After successfully intimidating the leader of the barbarian scouting party to return to their camp, the leader was unceremoniously beheaded by his second in command for cowardice. Battle ensued.

At one point, one warrior on death's door saw the true power that Resolute was wielding in the form of Baruda and begged that he not be slain by the corrupted blade of [[Durandal]].
Resolute struck him down and the flames of the pyre rose up to consume the essence of the fallen warrior, empowering Baruda further.

After dealing with the barbarian scouting party, an attempt was made to make the tower look like a "cursed" thing, discouraging other barbarians from investigating or getting too close to the tower.
The party makes their way north towards the Lurkwood in search of Cloud Lotus to fuel the grounded tower of Zephyros.
