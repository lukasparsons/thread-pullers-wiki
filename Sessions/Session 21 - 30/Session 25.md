The party continued through the skies of Faerun within Zephyros's Tower. 

After some time, Haffyd realized that the only logical explanation for the dimming of the runes surrounding the Orb controlling Zephyros's  tower is that whatever power source enables the flight of the tower after Zephyros's passing is beginning to fade. 

Additionally, a Kinku by the name of [[Corpus]] revealed themselves to the party, speaking with the disembodied voices of what seemed to be the dead. 
They carry upon their back a crate that smells of death and undeath clings to them like an odor. 

Resolute voiced his disdain for the apparent necromancy after using his Divine Sense to sus out the creature's ties to the taboo magic. This prompted a debate amongst the party on Resolute's own moral choices in making a pact with the entity known as Baruda. 

During this debate, a Wyvern in the area that noticed the tower soaring through the sky decided to investigate for food or treasure. The party was able to dispatch the Wyvern but the strain within the group continued as Resolute was revived from unconsciousness by Baruda in order to save Adonis who was plummeting to the earth's surface, leaving Durandal behind. 

Haffyd and Ti decided to take matters into their own hands and attempt to separate Durandal from Resolute but the magic binding the two goes deeper than a physical boundary of distance. Resolute was able to summon Durandal to himself and withstand a breath attack from Haffyd by temporarily giving himself over to Baruda. The party glides closer to their destination by the minute with tensions growing.
