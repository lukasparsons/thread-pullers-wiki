# Session 16: On the Road
## Session Summary
You all awoke in the different locations you had decided to rest the night before, Ti at the brewery with his family; Haffyd, Nethhala, and Adonis at the Northfurrow's End Inn; and Resolute manning the southern wall of Goldenfields at the point of ingress where a legion of goblins, ogres, and bugbears had entered being led by two hill giants.  

Resolute saved a slacking town guard who had nearly fallen off the edge of the wall while falling asleep at his post, and then made his way to join up with the party. 

You all collected a reward in the form of some items collected by Strog's men off the corpses of the invaders and set out to do some shopping before leaving town. You did some shopping at Jezra's General Goods before setting out with Naxene and Timothy Denovan towards Amphail. 

Near the end of your first day's travel, you encountered a disabled merchant cart with a man on the ground in front of it. Adonis approached cautiously while you all kept a distance, when suddenly a large Bulette leapt from its underground tunnel and lashed out at the man and Adonis in a vicious ambush. Adonis was nearly killed, but the party was swift to rush in and assist him while Naxene and the boy retreated to the nearby treeline. 

After the battle, the boy seemed to temporarily revert back to his feral state, up until that point having had a fairly normal day.  
However, with the boy calmed down and the threat dealt with, you collected what goods you could find in the cart and continued down the trail towards Amphail, finding a place to make camp and rest for the night before another long day's journey.
