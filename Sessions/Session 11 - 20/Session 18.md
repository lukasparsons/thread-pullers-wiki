# Session 18: Afterburn
## Session Summary
You all made your way from the outskirts of Amphail south-west towards Waterdeep. However, the small farming town of Rassalantar sits along your path on the Long Road. 

While making your way there over the several day's long journey, you witnessed several individuals quickly making their way towards Amphail to celebrate Lord Roaringborn's Nameday, including an eccentric wood salesman who was pleased to set up Ti and Nethhala with some beautifully carved walking sticks. 

One night during your journey, Haffyd believed he may have witnessed something in the sky during his watch, but overall his watch ended uneventfully. During Adonis's watch however, a shadowy form fell from the clouds above and disappeared over the rolling hills near your camp. 

Upon investiagtion, you found that the mass that had fallen was a dwarven man with the symbol of the Howling hatred branded into his forehead.
The morning of the last day of your travel to Rassalantar, you were approached by Joskar and Fey Gersky, who seemed to be a couple of hunters. They answered questions about Rassalantar, but otherwise they made their way back towards their cabin. 

After arriving in Rassalantar, you made your way to the Sleeping Dragon Inn, seeing Naxene there with Timothy Denovan. She informed you that the pair had acquired a horse from a property near Amphail and had been traveling under cover of night along the Long Road.

The proprieter of the Sleeping Dragon, Yondral Horn, reveals himself to be an informant for the Zhentarim after hearing your party speak freely of pulling threads. He suspects that the Blackstaff of Waterdeep uses some method of teleportation to quickly travel to the Rassalantar Keep and then pass information to an informant within Rassalantar, but within the past couple months, no news has come. He asks the party to investigate the keep and see if you are able to "unclog the pipes". However, tensions rise as Yondral listened in on a conversation the party was having where some of you expressed disdain for "criminals" of his ilk. You all made your way downstairs again to have a hot meal or some drink before heading to bed.
