# Session 20: Unclogging the pipes
## Session Summary

*NOTE: Sessions 21-25 did not have a post-session summary, so they will not have much detail if at all.*

The party made their way into the basement of the Rassalantar Keep, fighting cultists while making their way to the deepest chamber under the ruined castle.

Upon arriving in the central chamber, they came upon a dark priest, the very same priest that attempted to help Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse escape during the altercation at Goldenfields.

Several cultists gave their bodies to become a flesh monster with psychic abilities.

After three full rounds of combat, the priest completed his ritual and teleported away. 

Through investigating the strange black growths around the teleportation circle the party was able to determine that the prist had "Hacked" the teleportation circle to take him somewhere other than Waterdeep.

The Blackstaff of Waterdeep Vajra Safahr arrived moments later to personally thank you for your efforts.
