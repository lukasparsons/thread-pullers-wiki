# Session 19: Into the Keep
## Session Summary
You all made your way downstairs into the main level of the Sleeping Dragon and found that Naxene had dozed off at her table and the boy was nowhere to be found.

Ti, with the help of Fenrir, rushed outside to look for the boy and found him at the treeline between the village and the Keep Woods. The boy was floating slightly off the ground and seemed to have been having some sort of communication with Baruda, the Demon Lord that you believe to be imprisoned within the Soul Prism that you all have in your posession.

The boy seemed to recall having been to this area before when he was kidnapped from Waterdeep and taken to Goldenfields. Nothing is known for sure, but Naxene believes that a teleportation circle within the Keep was used to quickly escape Waterdeep and teleport to the Keep in Rassalantar.

You have also learned that in recent months routine messangers from the Keep Woods have stopped arriving and the Innkeep Yondral Horn believes something has "clogged the pipes" at the keep and is preventing the messengers from returning.

You all rested for the night after calming the boy and convincing him to trust your party once again.
In the morning, you all made your way to Rassalantar Keep through the woods, following the stream. 

After arriving at the keep you found a mostly-empty main hall, with Haffyd noticing a barrel that seemed to be moved more frequently than the others but was also seemingly unmovable.
Resolute struck the barrel with Durandal, dispeling the magic that held it in place and allowed you to descend the tight stairs down into the dungeon below the keep. Therein you were greeted with darkness and partially collapsed walls. 

But more interestingly, you found a cloaked figure standing guard. After Adonis took them out, you noted an emblem emblazoned upon their cloak: A black sun with chains for rays extending from it.
