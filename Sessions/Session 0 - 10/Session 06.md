# Session 6: To the Skies

After safely returning to Nightstone with the surviving villagers, the party began to help in some minor repairs and helping the people get settled back into their homes.

Adonis was approached by Kella who was impressed with the way he had handled himself previously in the battle against the orcs. She offered to teach him a thing or two if he was able to catch her.
A chase ensued where Kella leapt out the window with Adonis close behind, displaying his physical prowess. The chase continued from rooftop to rooftop with stunning displays of acrobatics and ultimately ended with Adonis vaulting over a cart and landing in front of Kella, catching her. 
As a reward, Kella taught Adonis how to use Thieves' tools and become proficient with them. Kella also told Adonis that if he were to ever meet another member of the Zhentarim, to address them by saying 'I pulled a thread, and upon following it, it led me here.' and they would know that they were a friend of the Zhentarim.

Later on, the party made their way back to the Keep and did some studying at the library, where - due to the lack of light in the library for sure - Adonis was not able to find what he was looking for in terms of life-prolonging lore. 
Ti however was able to find a book that was written about certain "god-touched" individuals. It detailed a list of peoples that had claimed to have direct contact with the divine through physical manifestations or displays of favor. The book seemed to be the journal of some traveling scholar and scrawled upon one of the pages was the name "Aes'Piorun".

The reading was cut short however, as cries of panic rang out from the town square. The party rushed outside and a giant cloud was descending from the sky with an enormous tower extending into the sky atop of it. The villagers were in a frenzy believing they were once again under attack, but the cloud settled, and a swirling staircase made of cloud began to roll from the base of the cloud and settle to the ground before the party.
