# Lifferlas' Quest
Lifferlas urges the characters to seek out its creator, a moon elf druid named **Aerglas**. The awakened tree tells them that Aerglas was not only a member of the **Emerald Enclave** but also an adventurer who slew many giants in his day. Aerglas left Goldenfields thirty years ago on a pilgrimage to **Shadowtop Cathedral**. The druid planned to follow the **Dessarin River** and seek out an old Treant named **Turlang**. Lifferlas suggests that the characters do the same.
