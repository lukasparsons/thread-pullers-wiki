## Tips
This site supports **full text search**. For example, if you're not able to remember a particular detail about an NPC, you can begin to type their name in the search box at the top of the page, and you will see results for that character and quickly pull up relevant information!

There is a **Dark Mode** if you are so incined (which I very much prefer). If you wish to use it, simply click the little toggle switch at the top of the page to change to dark mode.

## F.A.Q.
To be fair there aren't really any "frequently asked questions" as much as I'm trying to predict questions you may have. If you think of anything else not in this list, let me know and I can add it.

### Q: How do I submit a note to be added to the wiki?
There are many different ways. We can decide as a group on a "standard" way of doing it where you guys take advantage of a shared google drive or similar to upload your .md files to. 
However, feel free to share your notes with me through discord (just drag and drop the file into chat) or email them to me at lukascparsons@gmail.com.

### Q: What is markdown?
Markdown is simple once you use it a little bit. It is simply a way of taking notes that make them automatically look aesthetically pleasing and structured. I'm using it right now! I'll provide a couple examples:
```
# This is a heading
## This is a smaller heading (you can keep going up until ######)
**This is bold!**
*This is italic*
- This is a bullet point
```
These are really all you need to know in order to get rolling making some awesome stuff. All you really need to get started is the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) but if you want to take a more in-depth look at markdown, you can have a look at [MarkdownGuide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and really dig in.

### Q: How do I write a ".md" file?
The best way to write a markdown(.md) file is to use an editor that can show you the results of your markdown in real time! An excellent option is [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/). But in reality, you could open up a new document in notepad, and as long there aren't any errors with your markdown, it will work and look great once it is loaded into the site! Pretty cool stuff.

### Q: Is this mandatory? / Why should I bother?
No, it is not mandatory for you to write notes and submit them to me for the purposes of displaying here. The reason I made this site was so that I could easily share content with you in an aesthetically pleasing way, and because I wanted a Campaign log and I didn't like any "out of the box" solutions available online. **The point is**, this can be as relevant or irrelevant as you wish it to be. I will continue to use it as a campaign log, but it is up to the party if you wish to interact with it further and allocate notes here. I think it would be an excellent resource, but primarily I think it would build a sense of achievement and progression  as you watch your notes and adventures grow here.
