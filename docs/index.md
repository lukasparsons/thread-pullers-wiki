# Welcome Thread-Pullers,
This is the wiki for our SKT Campaign. Here you will see several things:
- Adventure Log
- NPC information
- Location Information
- Item Information
- Whatever the hell else you guys decide you want to see.

However, I want **YOUR** help making this even better. The pages on this website are rendered from markdown (.md) files. You can use an online markdown editor tool like [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/) to write your own pages! Simply write up your own page, and save it as a file (PageNameHere.md) for example, and send it to me in Discord and I will add it to the site. 
Here is a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for markdown that will get you up to speed quickly on how to format your markdown to look ***pretty***.

	- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

If you want, your task to familiarize yourself with markdown and to help the site will be to write a character bio in your own words for your character. I would include things like
- Age / Race / Gender
- Class
- Ideals
- Goals
- Family
- Background story (Whatever you are comfortable sharing with the group)

If you guys help me make this an awesome and unique resource for us, there may be some benefits in game. Who knows? Perhaps a powerful NPC will approach you with a magical item, asking you to keep it safe until they return for it sometime in the future. Or perhaps the party will stumble across a wizard's tower that has appeared in a location it wasn't previously that is filled with mystery, treasure and adventure. In short, I will find a way to reward the group for their participation in making this site really awesome.

	P.S. - I don't want to be the only one filling this wiki out. I will put info like Quests and Session Recaps on here consistently, but it would really bring me joy if you guys used this to compile the party's information on NPCs, Locations, Long-Term plans, Secrets and Clues you've uncovered, etc. Unfortunately I don't have a way to allow you to directly edit this website, but if there is a .md file for any subject you want notes on and it is in a shared location such as a google drive folder or similar, I will check that folder every Saturday between sessions and update the site to have the most recent versions before the next session. That way you can have the site pulled up on a tab or on your phone to reference during the game!
