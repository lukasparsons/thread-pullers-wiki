# The Shadowy Figure

Found to later be known as Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse, a former paladin of Helm, cousin of Resolute Du'Coreiseuse and Son of the Holy Smith of Helm - Waylan Du'Coreiseuse. 
The shadowy figured wields a dark version of Resolute's sword, Durandal.

His motives are still unknown to the party, but he was seen traveling with an Old Cleric in robes of gray and black with a large skull pendnat on his chest. 

Vanquished during the Attack on Goldenfields by Ti, Resolute, and Haffyd.
