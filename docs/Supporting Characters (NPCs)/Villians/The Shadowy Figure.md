# The Shadowy Figure

Found to later be known as **Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse**, a former paladin of Helm, cousin of Resolute Du'Coreiseuse and Son of the Holy Smith of Helm - Waylan Du'Coreiseuse. 
The shadowy figure wields a dark version of Resolute's sword, Durandal.

His motives are still unknown to the party, but he was seen traveling with an Old Cleric in robes of gray and black with a large skull pendant on his chest. 

- First seen on the road leading to the Bronsson Homestead in Session 10
- Vanquished during the Attack on Goldenfields by Ti, Resolute, and Haffyd.
