## Recap

Review [[House Rules]]
```

```ad-info
Previously, after purging the Bronsson tomb of the evil that had penetrated its defenses, you made your way back to the Bronsson home, only to find it ransacked with Ti's mother hiding in a hidden room under the stairs. You decided to take her to Goldenfields and meet up with Ti's brothers Steven and Gah, the new owners and operators of the recently renamed brewery, "Bronzewing Brewery", previously "Goldengulp Brewery". After making it to Goldenfields, some shopping was done, and reunions were made. At Steven and Gah's request, you agreed to investigate the strange reports of cries and strange sounds coming from the cellar that had recently been sealed off as the brothers believed these noises to be echoes of the witchraft that the previous proprieter of the brewery was allegedly performing down there.

Upon entering the cellar however, you discovered, in addition to the valuable casks of Goldengulp ale, remnants of a magic circle of some sort scorched into the ground, seemingly confirming the twins' suspicions. Out of the corner of his eye, Resolute saw a shadow move from behind a cask to a stack of them in the corner of the cellar. After calling for the rest of the party to come join, Ti, thinking on his feet decided the best course of action was caution and lit the room ablaze using the fine ale as an accelerant. However, as the flames died down you didn't hear screams of pain or see some evil creature burning, but instead you saw a young boy no older than 10 standing in the flames, unburning, as most of his clothing was reduced to tatters.

This is where we pick up tonight's game.

## Strong Start

[[The Boy]] screams and swears in infernal before falling into growls and grunts as he tries to pull himself away from the group. Through his tattered and charred clothes that hang from his body, you see a small branding in the center of his chest. (A diamond inside of a circle)

As the flames settle in the cellar, you see a few papers partially burned and now soaking in what remains of the moisture on the ground. [[Notes in the Cellar]]

## Fantastic Locations

### [[Northfurrow's End]]
- Three story stone structure with arched windows that offers a view surrounding gardens.
- Thin plumes of smoke issue from its many chimneys, and life-size statues of rearing horses flank the double doors that lead into the establishment's common room. A wooden sign that proclaims the name of this grand establishment, Northfurrow's end, hangs above the large double doors.
- The inside of the establishment is laid out as a large and open common room with two double-sided fireplaces placed equidistant from eachother and the opposite sites of the room, with tables and sitting areas scattered throughout. A bar runs the length of the tavern on the wall to your left as you enter.
- You smell the smokey scent of the crackling fires. Warm and welcoming.

### [[Bronzewing Brewery]]
- Smells of must and stale ale in the best way possible.
- Everything feels slightly damp all the time.

### [[Dragon's Spire]]
- There was a mistake in the building of the brewery, and it was built larger than its allotted footprint and the workers didn't realize until they met at the back right corner of the building while laying the foundation. Rather than fix the mistake, the builders just built the brewery around the tower, encapsulating a portion of its base inside the brewery.
- The centuries old structure that was built around the same time that the walls were built in order to be able to see over the walls of Goldenfields in all directions.
- A spiraling staircase climbs up the the entirety of the structure with floors built in every so often and 4 stone pillars run the height of each level supporting the level above.

### [[Harvesthome Abbey]]
- Largest most elaborately carved building in Goldenfields. Centuries old
- Well-tended hedges and a sun-shaped window of stained glass above the entrance. Narrow windows of stained glass are decorated with images of wheat, fruit, and vegetables run the length of the building.
- The inside is decorated with tapestries of cornucopias and depictions of the goddess [[Chauntea]]

## Important NPCs
**[[Shalvus Martholio]]**: [[Zhentarim]] spy. sent to Goldenfields to see how it can be brought under the Black Network's control. *He is dark of skin, his hair is dreaded and pulled back and tied behind his head. The two dreads that fall in front of his face each have a long brown bead. He wears a coat with a large white fur collar, the rest of the coat seems to be made from the rest of the large, white furry creature that the fur was taken from.*

**[[Naxene Drathkala]]**: Agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]] and a loyal spy for [[Lady Laeral Silverhand]] of Waterdeep. She knows the identity of [[The Boy]].

**[[Ellardin Darovik|Abbot Ellardin Darovik]]**: Manages the city and is a member of the [[Emerald Enclave]].

**[[Strog Thunderblade]]**: Captain of the guard. Lazy and laxadaisical. He knows his position is one of pleasantry and image, so he doesn't put much effort into his job.

**[[Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse]]**: Masked figure that has been terrorizing the group. Wants to exchange Ti's Father's safety for the [[Soul Prism]].

## Log

## Reflection
After discovering [[The Boy]], you all attempted to communicate with him. Through his spouts of infernal, the boy was barely able to speak a word in common. [[Strog Thunderblade]] came to investigate why he had begun to smell smoke from his office located in the [[Dragon's Spire]] which is connected to the back of the brewery. With a Natural 20 on his insight check, he was not dissuaded from investigating the source of the disturbance, but with Ti's high persuasion role he did not think you all hostile as much as you were just messing around and worried about getting in trouble. Upon seeing the boy, and not wanting to get involved, Strog pointed you in the direction of [[Naxene Drathkala]], resident mage of [[Goldenfields]] and a member of the [[Watchful Order]]. After bringing her back to the brewery to see the boy, she immediately recognized the boy as [[The Boy|Timothy Denovan]], a Waterdhavian noble. After you shared with her that you had the [[Soul Prism]] and Circlet, she recognized the Prism as being something she had made with her old friend and colleague [[Cassander Yvonnette]]. (Note, the circlet was not something that she made with him but was housing the Prism when he brought it back to her.) Additionally, you learned the legend of the devil [[Baruda]] and based on the note found in the cellar, believe he may be the entity contained within the Prism.
Once you exchanged all information, her working theory was that the boy had been the subject of a Soul Transferrance Spell that had failed with the boy and whatever is within the Soul Prism being the targets.
You exchanged thoughts and theories over the best way to deal with the Prism as she was charged with destroying it, but it is what is keeping Ti's father alive. You agreed to deal with it later and perhaps discuss traveling to Waterdeep together to deliver the boy back to his family and seek help of more powerful mages in curing the boy of his affliction.
