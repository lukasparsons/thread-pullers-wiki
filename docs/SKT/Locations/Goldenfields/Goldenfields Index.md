# G1. Gatehouse

#gf_gatehouse
The Northfurrow trail ends before a magnificent stone gatehouse carved with images of a full-bodied woman (representations of Chauntea) cradling cornucopias. The gatehouse is a fortress in its own right. Above its tall, thick wooden doors are arrow slits that seem to peer down suspiciously on all visitors.

The gatehouse has an inner set and an outer set of double doors. When locked, these doors are too thick to be forced open using brute strength. They can be damaged and broken down, however. Each set of doors has AC 16, 500 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

The gatehouse staff operates in three daily shifts that end at five bells in the morning, one bell in the afternoon, and nine bells at night, respectively. Each shift consists of a [priest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/priest) of Chauntea (NG male or female Illuskan human), four [acolytes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/acolyte) (NG male and female humans of mixed ethnicity), a hired [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage) (N male or female Illuskan human), ten [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout) (N male and female humans of various ethnicities) hidden behind arrow slits, and thirty well-trained [guards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/guard) (N male and female humans of various ethnicities). The gatehouse castellan is a Waterdhavian noble who is appointed by the Masked Lords of Waterdeep and holds the post for a year, beginning on the first day of winter. The current castellan, a boorish twit named [[Hantanus Tarm]] (LN male Illuskan human [noble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/noble)), is responsible for defending the gates but has no military experience. The gatehouse guards report to him, but his position is seen as mostly political and ceremonial, and he has no influence anywhere but at the gatehouse. The gatehouse is spacious enough to accommodate the members of all three shifts, and any attack on the gates brings the full force of the gatehouse staff to bear.

Merchants and other visitors who come seeking food are rarely turned away, but their wagons and belongings are thoroughly searched in the gatehouse to make sure they contain nothing that could damage crops, such as rodents and vermin. Guests who want to spend the night are directed to Northfurrow's End (area G8).

# G2. Watch Posts

#gf_watchposts
At more or less regular intervals around the perimeter of Goldenfields, the outer wall (which is 60 feet high on the outside and 20 feet high on the inside) widens to accommodate broad stone parapets with buildings atop them. Each parapet features a 30-foot-tall stone pagoda topped by a weather vane. A wooden statue of Chauntea stands in the middle of each pagoda, holding a large bronze gong and surrounded by cornucopias. Next to each pagoda are one or two stone outbuildings that serve as barracks. A 10-foot-wide, moss-covered stone staircase leads from the top of the parapet down to the compound. A set of locked, ironbound wooden doors at ground level provide access to storerooms and cellars located underneath each watch post. Picking a door lock requires thieves’ tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The rooms and cellars are packed with harvested fruit and vegetables in the fall and are empty by midwinter.

The watch posts are crucial to the defense of Goldenfields. Stationed at each post are thirty [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout) (NG males and females of various races and ethnicities) two-thirds of whom are on duty at any given time. The rest are asleep in their bunks. Of the twenty scouts on duty, twelve are stationed on the parapet, spread hundreds of yards apart and looking outward for signs of trouble. The other eight patrol the adjacent walls in pairs.

The watch posts are far enough apart that shouts of alarm are ineffective. If a watch post needs to sound an alarm, a guard runs to the pagoda and strikes the gong with a heavy mallet. The pagodas are designed to amplify sound, allowing the ringing of each gong to be heard as far as two miles away. Any other watch posts within that range ring their gongs as well, putting more of the compound on alert.

The watch posts were designed to warn Goldenfields of approaching armies and dragons. Even though the watch posts and the wall patrols provide a great measure of security, a small group of invaders could scale the outer wall and enter the compound undetected if they were lucky enough to avoid the notice of the guards.

# G3. Earth Mother's Bounty

#gf_earthmothersbounty
The first thing visitors to Goldenfields see as they pass through the gatehouse is a 20-foot-tall wooden statue of Chauntea, depicted as a plump, smiling woman standing with her hands on her hips in a garden of golden wheat, surrounded by a dirt roundabout. North of the statue is a stone building with an open front, above which hangs a sign that reads “Earth Mother’s Bounty.” Visitors can buy seeds and cornucopias here. Tasked by the abbot with overseeing the store and its inventory is [[Sevembra Tumbleleaf]] (LN female strongheart halfling [druid](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/druid)), a member of the Emerald Enclave who sells nothing but the finest seeds. She also gives away lots of free samples.

# G4. Grain Towers

#gf_graintowers
Grain is stored in these squat stone towers.

# G5. Livestock Fields

On the outskirts of the town are two large fields of roaming oxen and cattle, with cordoned-off pens for sheep, chickens, turkeys, and pigs. Each field is roughly a half-mile in diameter and enclosed by wooden fences with rearing horses carved into their posts. During the day, shepherds as well as workers with milk buckets and wool shears can be seen moving among the herds of cows and sheep.

One of the new shepherds, [[Shalvus Martholio]] [(Stat Page)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/shalvus-martholio) (see [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/skt/special-npcs#AppendixDSpecialNPCs)), is a Zhentarim spy — a wolf in sheep’s clothing, as it were. His assignment is to determine how easy it would be for the Black Network to gain control of Goldenfields, and report his findings to Nalaskur Thaelond in Bargewright Inn. Shalvus often leaves the livestock pens to hang around Northfurrow's End. He returns to the pens at night to check on the animals.

# G6. Town
#gf_town
The buildings that house most of the residents of Goldenfields are arranged in concentric half-rings around a central square where locals can socialize and gather for picnics after midday prayers. Orderly rows of wooden longhouses, each one large enough to house a hundred people, face inward toward a central plaza, with the abbey of Chauntea off to the southeast. Each longhouse is a work of art, its beams sculpted with images of a particular animal, thereby differentiating it from its neighbors. Most of Goldenfields’ workers are human [commoners](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/commoner). A handful of peaceful Chauntea worshipers (NG male and female [druids](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/druid) of various races and ethnicities) live and work among them.

Wagons and wheelbarrows are parked just about everywhere, free for anyone to use. The oxen needed to pull the wagons are kept in the livestock fields (area G5).

A grove of trees south of town is home to three young treants. If the town or the abbey comes under attack, their job is to animate nearby trees and aid in the town’s defense. The grove is also home to an awakened tree named [[Lifferlas]] [(statpage)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/lifferlas) (see [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/skt/special-npcs#AppendixDSpecialNPCs)). Created by a long-dead druid, Lifferlas is the oldest living resident of Goldenfields. It speaks Common and has long entertained the children of the workers with harrowing, often humorous tales of heroes and monsters, as well as legends about the gods, Chauntea in particular. The tree allows children to climb it while it walks about cautiously with hosts of them clinging to its boughs and screaming with delight.

# G7. Harvesthome Abbey
The largest and most elaborate building in Goldenfields is the abbey, Harvesthome, a centuries-old stone edifice whose outer walls have statues of Chauntea at every corner, her hands raised to the sky as though casting a spell to summon rain. Well-tended hedges surround the foundation, and a sun-shaped window of stained glass is set above the entrance and the steps leading up to it. Narrow windows of stained glass decorated with images of wheat, fruit, and vegetables light the pillared arcades within. Toward the back of the building, mounted between sturdy roof beams, is a large bronze bell that is rung fifteen minutes before prayers every morning, noon, and evening.

Wandering the abbey halls are two old [black bears](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/black-bear) named [[Darlow and Tilbee]]. A few months ago, they startled some workers in the south fields. No one could fathom how the two bears crept into the compound unseen, spurring rumors that they were gifts from the Earth Mother. Rather than drive them out, the workers sheltered and fed them. The bears eventually followed workers into the abbey. They try to mooch food from visitors while posing no danger to anyone.

The Abbot of Goldenfields, [[Ellardin Darovik]] (NG male Damaran human [priest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/priest)), is a worshiper of Chauntea and a member of the Emerald Enclave. He’s a generous, reserved man who avoids confrontation and doesn’t like to ruffle feathers. He leads prayer services at nine bells in the morning, highsun, three bells in the afternoon, and six bells in the evening, and though attendance isn’t mandatory, most workers take a break from their chores once a day to hear the abbot’s words.

There are no guards in the abbey, just a handful of acolytes. One of them, [[Zi Liang]] [statpage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/zi-liang) (see [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/skt/special-npcs#AppendixDSpecialNPCs)), has scolded Father Darovik many times for putting the defense of Goldenfields in the hands of incompetent military leaders, which has made her somewhat unpopular. When she isn’t busy with chores or prayers, Zi takes it upon herself to patrol the outer walls.

# G8. Northfurrow's End
Standing north of the town is a three-story stone edifice with arched windows that offer a view of the surrounding gardens. Thin plumes of smoke issue from its many chimneys on rainy days and cold nights. Life-size statues of rearing horses flank the double doors that lead to the common room. Above these doors hangs a wooden sign that proclaims the name of this grand establishment, [[Northfurrow's End]], in fancy lettering. West of the main building is a stable house that can hold and feed up to fifty horses.

The proprietor of the inn is an elder member of the Fellowship of Innkeepers guild of Waterdeep and, as such, must operate within the strictures of his guild. His name is [[Miros Xelbrin]] [statpage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/miros-xelbrin), and he’s a retired carnival attraction — dubbed “the Yeti” during his heyday because of his barrel-shaped body and the thick, white hair covering his arms, chest, back, and head.

Miros is a staunch supporter of the [[Emerald Enclave]] and offers free room and board to members of the organization and their companions. His rooms are spacious and comfortable, his food plentiful and delicious (made with only the freshest ingredients). He has little tolerance for rabble-rousers and can spot adventurers from a mile away. Miros employs a staff of twenty cleaners and servers. He sells a local brand of beer called [[Goldengulp]], though the first flagon to a new customer is always free.

In the back of [[Northfurrow's End]] is a pottery kiln that Miros uses to make the inn’s trademark flagons. These large, varnished clay mugs have sheaves of golden wheat painted on their sides. Miros doesn’t sell these minor works of art, but the mugs are occasionally stolen and sold elsewhere.

One of the patrons of Northfurrow’s End at present is a visitor from [[Waterdeep]]. That city’s [[Watchful Order]] of Magists and Protectors has an agreement with the abbot. Every midwinter, the guild sends one of its members to [[Goldenfields]] as a sign of its commitment to protecting Waterdeep’s interests. The wizard serves for one year and acts as a liaison between the city and the abbot, while also aiding in the defense of Goldenfields. The guild’s current attaché is [[Naxene Drathkala]] [statpage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/naxene-drathkala), a quiet and bookish young woman who lives in a lavishly furnished suite above the inn’s stable house and spends most of her time writing papers on subjects both arcane and esoteric. In addition to being a member of the Watchful Order, Naxene is an agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]] and a loyal spy for Lady Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep. Miros has tried to court Naxene, but she ignores his halting advances.

Among the other guests of Northfurrow’s End are numerous actors, musicians, acrobats, and other performers from Waterdeep and Daggerford. These spirited folk entertain locals during afternoon picnics in the town circle (area G6). A halfling singer and lute player named [[Oren Yogilvy]] [statpage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/oren-yogilvy) (see [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/skt/special-npcs#AppendixDSpecialNPCs)) is the only permanent resident of the inn among them. He has a fondness for Goldengulp and gets free room and board for keeping the residents of Goldenfields entertained. After a few drinks, Oren likes to wander the compound in search of inspiration and often wakes up in a field the morning after.




# G13 Wheat Fields
Nearly half of the tilled earth in Goldenfields is set aside for growing wheat. During the harvest season, the wheat fields are full of workers wielding scythes and carrying bushels of sheared wheat over their shoulders.
This is the point of insurrection when [[Giants Attack Goldenfields]]
