# Bronzewing Brewery

###### Flavor Text: 
*This brewery has seen better days but still holds its original charm well. The interior is an industrial warehouse with a tavern dropped in the center of it. In the middle of the large warehouse is a bar in a square shape that faces all directions. In the center of the bar are stacked barrels that are tapped. Pulling a lever releases an empty barrel and drops the next one down in order to be tapped.*

#### Person In Charge:
---
[comment]: # (Person in charge of the Site. The boss.)
[[The Bronsson Twins|Steven Bronsson]] and [[The Bronsson Twins|Gah Bronsson]] run the establishment. They recently obtained ownership of the establishment after the previous owner, [[Walton Barley]] was suspected of witchcraft and black magic and supposedly fled town in the middle of the night.

##### Underlings:
- [[Tubs Mcfarlen, Rudy Gibson, and Clarice Stone]] are the primary employees at the golden gulp. There are other bus boys, waiters, and minor workers who work part-time, but these three are the main workers with Tubs and Rudy working primarily on the brewing process and Clarice being the main bartender.

### Important NPCs

### Details
---
Description:

Goldenfields' brewery is a stately, two-story manse where a beer called Goldengulp was made, using the finest local barley and hops. Longhouses in the brewerey's front yard are home to the sixty commoners who comprise the brewery staff. In the same area is a locked stone warehouse packed to the rafters with casks of Goldengulp. A locked door can be picked open with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check


**Main Areas:**
- The Main Floor of the Brewery with tables and chairs and a central bar facing all sides of the establishment
- The [[Bronzewing Cellar]]
- The [[Dragon's Spire]]
- The Loft which sits above the kitchen in the back of the establishment.
- The [[Bronzewing Warehouse]] which sits in the area in front of the establishment.
- The several homes in the yard behind the establishment which used to house the many workers when it was the Goldengulp brewery. Several of them are now empty after the brewery was briefly shut down before reopening as the Bronzewing Brewery.

**Faction if Any:**
There aren't any real ties to a faction, but being this close to the [[Emerald Enclave]] means they are kind towards them and the enclave members in Goldenfields see the brothers as friendly. The [[Zhentarim]] is also scouting the place out as a possible interesting location.
