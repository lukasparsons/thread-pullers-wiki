### Summary ###
---
Hanatus tarm is the Gatehouse Castellan of [[Goldenfields]]. He is a pompous, well to do, elected official. However, he is not elected by the people of [[Goldenfields]]. He is chosen by the Lords' Alliance. The Gatehouse Castellan is a position of feigned authority because they hold no true power in the city but is more so a role of ceremony and a representation of the presence of the [[Lords' Alliance]] in the city.
