# Attack on [[Goldenfields]]
[DDB](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/skt/rumblings#:~:text=the%20outer%20wall.-,Attack%20on%20Goldenfields,for%20her%20voracious%20appetite.,-Two%20of%20these)
```ad-abstract
## Description:
[[Lob and Ogg]] have been sent by Guh with a goblinoid strike force. A few weeks ago, the two giants ran into a group of [[Bugbear]]s and [[Goblin]]s who told them about a large farm. They decided to attack it by throwing stones. The archers at the wall retaliated with a barrage of arrows, driving them back to nurse their wounds. they spent the next month lost in the hiss trying to find their way back to [[Grudd Haug]]. Guh sent them back with a strike force.

```

```ad-note
Not long after the initial attack on [[Goldenfields]], [[Ellardin Darovik|Abbot Ellardin Darovik]] received reports of giant sightings throughout the Dessarin valley. he shared these reports with [[Strog Thunderblade]], Captain of the Guard. Unfortunately, Strog did nothing to prepare for another giant attack. In fact, he never got around to briefing his men or drafting workers or adventurers to help patrol the outer wall, as per the Abbot's instructions.

```

## Wakey, Wakey
If the players are sleeping in [[Northfurrow's End]]:
[[Oren Yogilvy]], half-drunk and stumbling outside, see [[Goldenfields Index#G8 Northfurrow's End]], spots the monstrous trespassers and sounds the alarm.

```ad-info
A mighty yell shatters the night’s silence. “We’re under attack!” the voice calls out. “To arms! To arms!” Gathering your wits and weapons, you stumble outside the inn. A low mist blankets the quiet gardens to the north and slinks between the rows of darkened longhouses to the south. A small figure stumbles around the corner of the nearest longhouse, loses his balance, and falls. You have never seen such a clumsy, disheveled halfling.
```

### Fight Mechanics:
This fight is going to be a little different.
Each of you is going to gain control of an NPC during this encounter. Some you have met and some you have not, and some are more useful in combat than others.

- How you play these characters is up to you, I will give them voice, but you give them action. However, please review their **ideals, bonds, and flaws**.
- All the NPCs are familiar with Goldenfields' defenses and can run to get help, if that's what the players want them to do. (See "Special NPCs in [SKT](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/skt/rumblings#AttackonGoldenfields)")

DM Note: Lay the enemies out on the battle mat (10 goblins, 4 bugbears, 2 ogres) and have them face off against the players like chess. Each square is 10 feet.

```
## Logistics
All of the bugbears, half (30) of the goblins and half (6) of the ogres, climb over the walls in the dead of night.
The invaders scale the eastern wall at the point marked X on the map and enter the wheat fields ([[Goldenfields Index#G13 Wheat Fields]])
### [[Attack on Goldenfields Initiative Tracker]]
```ad-danger


|                   | [[Ogre]]s          | [[Bugbear]]s | [[Goblin]]s | [[Hill Giant]]s |

| **Total**         | 12                 | 12           | 60          | 6  (sacks)      |  

Once inside, the invaders split into three groups that head to different areas.

2. Party encounters a second group at either the Animal Pens (G5) which is closer, or the grain towers to the south west (G4).

## Development
```ad-warning
Neither Lob nor Ogg want to die. If either of them are dropped to below 15 hit points, they will surrender, falling to the ground and beginning to sob like a big baby. 
If questioned, they respond by blubbering incoherantly. A successful `DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation)` check pries the following information out of a defeated but conscious hill giant:
 - "Guh want food."
 - "Me get food for Guh."
 - "Guh big. Real big. Bigger than me."
 - "Grudd Haug. Home."
```

## Treasure
- Each hill giant, 1d4-1 art object worth 250 gp each. 
- Each bugbear carries a pouch that holds 1d6 gemstones worth 10gp each.
- Each goblin carries 1d6 cp in a pouch as well as various worthless belongings (necklaces made of woven dwarf beards an strung with halfing ears, bowls made from human skulls, etc).
## After the battle
- [[Strog Thunderblade]] puts any surviving invaders to death, and tries to take credit for the victory.
- [[Ellardin Darovik|Abbot Ellardin Darovik]] knows better, and thanks the characters profusely, an dmakes sure they are cited for their heroics, and **makes sure they are well supplied** when the time comes for them to leave.
```ad-info
Ask the characters for a name for their group so Abbot Darovik can cite their heroics properly.
```
- Based on the NPC's that survive the battle, they get a [[Goldenfields Quests | Quest]].
