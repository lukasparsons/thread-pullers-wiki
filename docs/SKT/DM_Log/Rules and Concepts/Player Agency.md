# Player Agency


According to gamedeveloper.com, player agency can be defined as:
	**The player's ability to impact the story through the game design or gameplay**.


In the realm of D&D stealing a player's agency can take many forms. One of them can be interjecting during a dialogue that one or more characters are having together or with an NPC. The player stealing the agency may think the conversation is a waste of time and decide to chime in and begin to control the conversation. This would steal player agency from the other players who were trying to have the conversation.

Additionally, you can steal player agency with physical actions. If a player were to decide to do something another character doesn't agree with, for example: A wizard is in posession of an artifact that the players acquired at the behest of a dubious NPC at the promise of a handome reward. The wizard begins to ask the NPC what they plan to use it for, and what their motives are. The party's barbarian doesn't like this conversation and simply wants to turn in the quest and move on with their reward, so the barbarian walks up to the wizard and forcibly takes the artifact from the wizard and hands it to the NPC. This would be stealing the wizard's agency, keeping them from affecting the story through their choices and gameplay.

The best choice is always to **talk it out**. A player should always talk to the party about their differences in opinion and what steps to take. A player should never, if avoidable, force their will upon another player through force or anything other than discussion. 

The [[House Rules]] go over how situations of stealing player agency will be discouraged and dealt with.
