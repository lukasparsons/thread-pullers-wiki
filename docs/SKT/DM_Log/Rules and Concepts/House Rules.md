# House Rules
---

# 1. Crits
Critical hits can be rolled by doubling the amount of dice rolled OR by rolling the normal amount of dice and multiplying the result by 2.

Optional Rule: Crunchy Crits. When you roll a die for a critical hit, instead of doubling the result or rolling an extra die, take the maximum amount of the extra damage dice that would have been rolled. Note: This would also apply for monsters and villians.

# 2. Potions
Potions may be consumed as a bonus action instead of an action

# 3. Flanking
We do use flanking after discussing it with the group on 2021-12-14.

# 4. Round Down
When you make a roll that requires rounding, always round down. This goes for the DM as well.

# 5. Player Agency
To dissuade players from stealing others of their [[Player Agency]], any roll made that the DM sees as stealing agency from a player, the player that is resisting the show of force will make their roll at advantage. This goes for physical grapples, physically taking things from another player when it isn't narratively appropriate, spells that charm another player, dialogue, and more. Additionally, if there is a large discrepency between the abilities of the accused agency-stealer and the victim player, such as a barbarian trying to shove a wizard to somehow steal his agency, DM reserves the right to enforce disadvantage on the barbarian regardless of the barbarian's ability to typically have advantage on strength checks. If there is a large disparity between the skill checks, the agency-stealer will roll at disadvantage and the victim player will roll with advantage.

# 6. Meta-Gaming
[[Meta-Gaming]] is bad. Don't do it. If you are found guilty of meta-gaming, DM reserves the right to hit you with 1d4 psychic damage and make your character dance involuntarily for up to a minute. Additionally, if it is questionable whether a given choice would have been made without the use of meta-gaming, DM reserves the right to enforce the roll at disadvantage, not always banning the action while reserving the right to do so, but giving it less of a chance to succeed.

# 7. The Rule of Cool
Want to do something awesome that isn't explicitly mentioned in the Player's Handbook? Tell me what it is and I'll do my best to rule justly on the subject.
This could also be called the "Give and Take" rule. If you want to do something crazy that makes sense from a narrative and character standpoint and you're wililng to sacrifice something of great importance, we can agree on something. (This does not mean you can sacrifice your eye for something because you think your character would look cool with an eyepatch. That isn't really a sacrifice, because you gain something you like. Unless you were to permanently take disadvantage on all dexterity checks, then we could talk.)

# 8. Token of Inspiration
If you do something that I deem super cool and in-character, then I may reward you with a Token of inspiration that you can use to reroll any one d20 roll during the sesison. You may only ever have one token of inspiration at a time. Inspiration Tokens expire at the end of every session unless otherwise stated by the DM, (because the cool thing happened at the end of the session for example). DM also reserves the right to give a token to a player who is having a rough night of rolls in order to help them get back in the game, if I'm feeling nice.
