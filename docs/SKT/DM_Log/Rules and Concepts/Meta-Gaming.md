# Meta-Gaming

Meta gaming can be defined as a player making a choice through their character using knowledge that the player has but the character would not.
An example of meta-gaming:
The Party's warlock is visited by their patron in their dream and is given a specific task they are to complete at the location the party is currently traveling to. This is a morally questionable task to prove loyalty to the Patron. This vision is roleplayed in front of the entire group of players, but the warlock's character is the only one that experiences it.
The next morning, the party arises, the warlock does not reveal this vision to the group, and the group's bard, deciding to meta-game, says to the group that they think the party should go to another town or city and not to the location they were already heading, giving some arbitrary reason that would not be realistic for the character, but in actuality, the player of the bard does not want the events of the Warlock's dream to unfold.

This is a prime example of meta-gaming. The Bard Character does not have the knowledge of the Warlock's dream and therefore would have no reason to awake one morning and decide to change the course of their adventure. They are doing so because the player has knowledge that the character does not.
