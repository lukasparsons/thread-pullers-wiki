## Ti's Outburst
This is an uncomfortable event that occurred during [[Session 11]] between [[Nethhala]] and [[Ti]]. It started with the players needing to clear out the [[Bronzewing Brewery]] in order to search the cellar.

## Context
The party had just taken the [[Soul Prism]] and Ti was wearing it around his neck. [[Ti|Tommy]] later used this as a partial justification for his reaction, although I had not given him any note or indication that the prism affected Ti's personality in any way.

[[Resolute]] had already gone about calmly clearing the patrons from the establishment by going to each table and informing them that they will be temporarily closing for maintenance purposes, and Tommy took [[Player Agency]] away from Resolute by standing up on the counter to address the entire establishment at once.

Nethhala didn't like this and rather than try to convince him to stand down and allow Resolute to continue evacuating the establishment, she physically imposed herself over Ti beating him in two different rolls, one to grapple, and one to pull from the counter top. Ti fell to the ground, but notably, when Nethhala rolled a natural 20 when pulling him from the counter, she jokingly stated "Can I suplex him from the counter top?" and everyone had a bit of a chuckle.

I laughed as well, but narrated that she simply pulled him from the counter top and did not in fact "suplex" him. Tommy however, decided to believe that she did in fact suplex him despite my narration of the event stating otherwise. When Ti was pulled to the ground, he responded by casting Eldritch Blast right at Nethhala and causing 11 points of force damage, which is no small amount to a level 4 party member.

[[Gwen Bronsson]], Ti's mother, reacted quickly and forcefully by slapping Ti and chastising him for acting rashly and pridfully. This clearly upset Tommy, though I don't think I could have played the character differently after the description of his mother that Ti gave me himself. The party was clearly surprised by Ti's overreaction to the situation. Tommy called me on the way home and was very upset by the event, at one point stating that he felt that Ti was being "sandbagged" as well as that I was "going easy" on Sarah and "refusing to see his side" of the events. I adamantly disagreed with his observations and replied repeatedly that I believe if Ti responded to that situation with an Eldritch blast, then all other characters reacted accordingly.

Notably, Tommy then went into the cellar and instead of interacting with the mystery / puzzle that was happening in there, he simply lit the cellar ablaze. I had to quickly think to give [[The Boy]] immunity to fire in order to prevent Ti from murdering a child. He was not even in the cellar when a small moving shadow was seen moving behind some of the barrels. He was guilty of [[Meta-Gaming]] the situation by using his knowledge of a player to know that there was something in the cellar and simply walked in and lit it ablaze even though Ti didn't know there was a boy in there.

12-02-2021: After speaking to Tommy, he recalls the brothers informing them of the movement upstairs. This may in fact be true. However, I don't believe it justifies the reaction of Tommy to immediately set the place ablaze with his friends inside.

- I wrote rules surrounding player agency and how to discourage it. 
- May need to go over player Agency with Sarah.
- Tommy can be very particular and has a short fuse.
