### Summary ###

^0fc5d0

Strog Thunderblade is Captain of the Guard in [[Goldenfields]]. However, he knows his position was given to him for the appearance of good will and inclusion, so he doesn't take his job seriously. He is lazy and laxadaisical. He even moved his office from the top floor of [[Dragon's Spire]] to the ground floor so he didn't have to climb the many steps to the top every day and he could be closer to the beer and food provided in the [[Bronzewing Brewery]]
- Half-Orc Man
- 37 years old
- Captain of the Guard in [[Goldenfields]]
- Physical Description:
	- He has black hair with a streak of white down the right side of his hair. Where the white stripe meets his forehead, a long burn scar runs down his head, over his one white with blindness eye, and past his chin and neck disappearing into his armor. He is not in the best shape for a Half-Orc and it looks like his armor doesn't quite fit like it used to. (Dad-bod).

#### Roleplay Notes ####
- Strog lets people believe he got his scar when he was returning from travels to his home village of [[Womford]] many years ago in the midst of a severe thunderstorm. The rumor states that he encountered a roaming pack of goblins under the command of a bugbear and he struck them down, and as he was delivering the final blow, he raised his sword up high and lighting struck him right as he delivered the killing blow to the bugbear leader, sending the remaining goblins fleeing in fear.
	- In reality, Strog was simply walking in a thunderstorm with his helmet on in lieu of an umbrella and he acted as a lighting rod.
- Strog likes anyone who enables his slacking and easy-going attitude.
- He uses veiled threats of imprisonment to those who question his ability to run the guard.
---
#### Goals ####
- Collect on his salary as Captain while performing as little of his duties as possible.
---
#### Flaws ####
- He is a vain slackard who does't take his job seriously, partially because he believes it was given to him as a formality and as a PR stunt.
