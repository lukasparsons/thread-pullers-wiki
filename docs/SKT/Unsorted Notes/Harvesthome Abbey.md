# Harvesthome Abbey

###### Flavor Text: 
*This is the largest and most elaborate building in [[Goldenfields]]. Harvesthome is a centuries-old stone structure who's outer walls have statues of [[Chauntea]] at every corner, her hands raised to the sky as though casting a spell to summon rain. Well-tended hedges surround the foundation, and a sun-shaped window of stained glass is set above the entrance and the steps leading up to it. Narrow windows of stained glass decorated with images of wheat, fruit and vegetables light the pillared walls along the outside. Toward the back of the building, mounted between sturdy roof beams, is a large bronze bell that is rung fifteen minutes before prayers every morning, noon, and night.*
