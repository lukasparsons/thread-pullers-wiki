## Summary

Resident mage of Goldenfields. Goldenfields' crops are vital to [[Waterdeep]]'s survival, which is why the [[Watchful Order]] of Magists and Protectors sent Naxene to make sure the temple-farm is adequately defended. At first she regarded the task as a punsihment, but now she appreciates the peace and quiet.
- Human Female
- 61
- Mage of the [[Watchful Order]]
- Physical Description:
	- Dark skin, dark curled hair pulled tightly back with streaks of grey throughout
	- Small circular spectacles that rest on the tip of her nose with small golden chains that come off the edges and wrap around her ears and meet in the back.
	- Red, Teardrop-shaped earrings. (These are miniature [[Soul Prism]]s with no souls within them.)

## Details
### Roleplay Notes
- ***Ideal:*** "there is no problem that can't be solved with magic."
- ***Bond:*** "I have great respsect for [[Lady Laeral Silverhand]] of [[Waterdeep]]. She and the [[Lords' Alliance]] are going to bring some much-needed order to this lawless land."
- ***Flaw:*** "I'm too smart to be wrong about anything."
### Secrets
- She knows the identity of [[The Boy]] to be [[The Boy|Timothy Denovan]], and that his true father is [[Cassander Yvonnette]].
- She was in love with [[Cassander Yvonnette]] long ago.
- She helped [[Cassander Yvonnette]] develop the [[Soul Prism]] as an academic pursuit, not knowing what he inteded to use it for.
- Cassander gave her the [[Circlet of Souls]], and looked to be only 30 something even though when he had seen him last he was nearing 70.
- She separated the [[Soul Prism]] from the [[Circlet of Souls]] and sold the circlet to [[Miss Harriet's Mystic Menagerie]] hoping it would change hands and end up far away from Goldenfields.
	- She meant to destroy the Prism, but couldn't bring herself to do it.
	- The Prism was stolen by [[Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse]] at the edge of a sword.
- Cassander told her that the Prism contained the soul of a devil, [[Baruda]]. His telepathic messages also had a part in stopping her from throwing it out.
### Goals
- Further her acedemic studies and become a powerful archmage in her own right.
- She wants to find and recover the [[Soul Prism]].
- Return [[The Boy]] to his family in [[Waterdeep]]
	- Find a way to remove the shard of [[Baruda]] from the boy.

### Flaws
- She never destroyed Cassander's Soul Prism even though he asked her to find a way, her curiosity and her nostalgia for his memory prevented her from doing so. She sold the [[Circlet of Souls]] at to [[Miss Harriet Baldun]] of [[Miss Harriet's Mystic Menagerie]], hoping the circlet would change hands and end up far away from Goldenfields.
- She thinks herself too smart to get into trouble.

## Friends and Foes

### Allies
- [[Lords' Alliance]]
- [[Lady Laeral Silverhand]]
- [[Miros Xelbrin]]

### Enemies
- [[Cult of the Chain Breaker]] - as led by [[Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse]]
- [[Emerald Enclave]] isn't an enemy persay, but she certainly doesn't agree with their ideals, and this causes friction on occasion.
