# Miros Xelbrin's Quest

## Description
```ad-abstract

```
[Miros](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/miros-xelbrin) suggests that the characters travel to [[Amphail]] and “give his regards” to [[Arleosa Starhenge]], the proprietor of a local tavern called the [[Stag-Horned Flagon]]. If the characters do so, Arleosa is delighted to hear that Miros is well and offers to buy them a round of drinks. The two performed together in a traveling carnival troupe many years ago.

If the characters make the effort to get to know Arleosa and reveal that they’re adventurers, Arleosa playfully recalls that she captivated a few adventurous admirers in her day. One of them, Arleosa says, was so enchanted with her that he gave her a wooden ring adorned with dancing nymphs and told her that it represented a special favor. Should she need anything, all she must do is whisper his name (“[[Keltar Dardragon]]”) into the ring, and he would appear and provide assistance. She never found the need to do so, but she offers the ring to the character she likes the most (as determined by you). The ring radiates evocation magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell.
## Development
```ad-warning
```

If a character whispers Keltar’s name into the ring while wearing it, a friendly halfling apparition appears within 5 feet of the ring’s wearer. The ring loses its magical property once the apparition appears. Nothing can alter Keltar’s cheery demeanor. The dead halfling points them in the direction of an old tower in the wilderness, claiming (in Common) that they’ll find useful items hidden inside it. If the characters follow Keltar’s directions, run the “[[Old Tower]]” encounter in chapter 3. The apparition can’t be harmed and provides no other assistance. It vanishes forever once it has imparted its information, waving goodbye as it fades away.
