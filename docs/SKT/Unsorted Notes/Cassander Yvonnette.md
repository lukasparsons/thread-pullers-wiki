## Notes
12-07-2021
Cassander's timeline:
1. Cassander warped into this version of the Forgotten Realms while trying to reset his timeline and save his wife and daughter.
2. He lived a normal life with an adventuring party for several years, but he was physically aged 65 - 70 at the time and in his spare time he worked on the [[Soul Prism]] with a friend, [[Naxene Drathkala]], telling her it was a defensive tool to be used against devils.
3. He used the [[Soul Prism]] along with the [[Circlet of Souls]] to draw from [[Baruda]]'s power and reverse his aging process. When he returned to Goldenfields to give the item to [[Naxene Drathkala]], he looked like he was no older than 30. He urged her to destroy it.
4. He returned to [[Assentia]] to begin his work, with the extra time he now had, to try and go back to his dimension to save his wife and daughter from [[Neronvain]] before he has a chance to kill his wife and take his daughter. Knowing this will probably doom his timeline, he plans to take his wife and child into Assentia and bring them back to this dimension to live together.

Cassander is currently in his pocket dimension wizard's tower, [[Assentia]], where he is researching how he can return to his own dimension, fearful that he has made too many mistakes.
