# Session 15: Aftermath

## Session Summary
In this session, the characters will collect their rewards from the battle, speak with the NPCs and survivors of the attack, and decide where they wish to go next.
## Recap
![[Session 14#^reflection]]
### Strong Start
```ad-info
As you make your way to the center of town, you are immediately cognizant of the uncanny silence that befalls the town square with the exception of the sound of distant now-dying flames that claimed several of the residential homes during the raid, and you recall that many of the villagers were fleeing to the North towards the brewery as the attack had risen up from the south. Goldenfields is saved thanks to your heroics, but not without loss as you see the bodies of commonfolk, the occasional guard or acolyte of the temple, and goblins, hobgoblins, and the like strewn throughout the area. What would you like to do?
```

## Characters
**[[Ti|Ti Bronsson]]**: What do they want.

## Scenes
- The players will head to the brewery and encounter the rest of town.
- [[Strog Thunderblade]] is there sheltering them and claiming that him and his men have taken care of the threat.
- The surviving NPCs will approach the players and give them their [[Goldenfields Quests]].
- [[Ellardin Darovik|Abbot Ellardin Darovik]] confronts [[Strog Thunderblade]] late in the evening, beckoning him to his tower in order to chastise him for not mounting a defense after he warned of the possibility of a second giant attack.
- Some NPC (Ellardin, Naxene, Strog, etc) tells the players that the issue of the giants needs to be dealt with as Goldenfields will not likely survive another attack.
- [[Naxene Drathkala]] asks if the players would be willing to guide [[The Boy]] North to [[Waterdeep]] or at least to take the boy to [[Helm's Hold]] where someone can escort him to Waterdeep.
