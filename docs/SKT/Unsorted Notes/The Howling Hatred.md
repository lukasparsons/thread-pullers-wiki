## Description
The Cult of the Howling Hatred gathered all air cultists. They were fascinated by the destructive power of wind and storms, and saw themselves as agents of [elemental air](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Air_(element) "Air (element)"), with the mission of punishing those who had wronged against the skies. Unlike the members of the other elemental cults, many Howling Hatred cultists used their new elemental powers only as instruments for a purpose. They never destroyed things for no reason, but only with the objective of expressing their personal freedom or to obtain things.

The Cult of the Howling Hatred recruited from among those who dealt in perceptions over facts: illusionists, spies, and assassins, for example. Predatory or fierce winged creatures of any kind, even non-sentient monsters usually too stupid and ravenous to be trained, tolerated and even submitted to the cultists. [Hippogriffs](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hippogriff "Hippogriff"), [griffons](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Griffon "Griffon"), and [giant vultures](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_vulture "Giant vulture") were frequently used as air cult steeds.
## Core Beliefs
Howling Hatred cultists' main personality traits were being clever, impulsive, and creative. They considered themselves as smarter, quicker, and more capable than any others they met. Air cultists disliked open battle. Their usual strategy was to work in secret advancing their plots with stealth and illusion and hitting their enemies with force only when they had to.
