# Zi Liang's Quest
```ad-abstract


```
In addition to being an acolyte of [[Chauntea]] and an [[Emerald Enclave]] sympathizer, [Zi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/zi-liang) is the beneficiary of a considerable inheritance from her parents, who traded in silk, whale oil, fine glass, maps, and other commodities. They were based in [[Baldur’s Gate]] but owned several businesses in [[Waterdeep]].
## Treasure
```ad-note

```
Zi gives the characters a black pearl pendant (worth 750 gp) that she keeps hidden among her belongings and tells them to bring it to Cauldar Marskyl (LG male Illuskan human [commoner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/commoner)), the head butler of House Thann in Waterdeep, where he will give them a gift in exchange.

[[House Thann]] is one of Waterdeep’s leading vintners, and although [[ Cauldar Marskyl]] is elderly and forgetful, he recalls with perfect clarity that the Thann family and Zi’s family are allies. He has been entrusted with some items that once belonged to Zi’s parents, and though Zi is now old enough to have them, she has no immediate need of them and prefers an ascetic lifestyle. If the characters show Cauldar the pendant, he understands that Zi has bequeathed her inheritance to them. He sends servants to the attic to retrieve an old wooden trunk and bring it to the characters, then unlocks it with a key and lets them claim the two magic items inside. Roll on Magic Item Table C in chapter 7 of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/treasure#RandomMagicItems) to determine each item. Cauldar offers to keep Zi’s pendant and see it safely returned to her, but he doesn’t protest if the characters insist on keeping it.
