# Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse
## Summary

Aadhan is the cousin of [[Resolute]] and first-born son of [[Wayland Du'Coreiseuse]]. He is older than Resolute, and he firmly believes that [[Durandal]] is his birthright. When [[Valandras]] chose Resolute over him, his jealousy burned within him until he was approached by a Cleric named [[Maokai]] who befriended him and slowly corrupted his soul until he broke his oath to Helm and became an agent of chaos. He believes that he has been chosen and once he completes the tasks that the cult has set before him, then he will be given the powers of a Demi-god.
