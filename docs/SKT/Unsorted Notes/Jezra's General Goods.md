###### Flavor Text: 
*You walk in and hear the creaking of old wooden floor boards. The establishment looked larger from the outside. The long red carpet runner has some sort of lovely pattern design that is barely visible through a line of dust carried in from patrons walking the dirt streets of Goldenfields. The walls behind the counter are split betwen a wall of many small square drawers with knobs in the middle tha rise up to the ceiling, and shelves full of tinctures, salves, and a healing potion or two. Hempen rope, Climbing gear, and many other odds and ends adorn the walls and ceiling hanging from arbitrarily placed nails throughout the small chamber. Not an inch of space is wasted.*
