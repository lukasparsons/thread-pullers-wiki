# Session 13: Giants Attack Goldenfields

## Session Summary
This session will be very heavily combat focused. The previous session ended with the players wrapping up for the evening. Naxene Drathkala should invite the players to stay at Northfurrow's End in order to get the players there for the beginning of the Giant's attack on Goldenfields.
During the fight, between squads of invaders, Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse will ambush the party and demand the stone. The players can either fight him, or give him the stone and fight the second group of invaders.
## Recap
![[Session 12#^session12reflection]]

### Strong Start
```ad-info
In the moments following the boy's spontaneous cast of fireball, you hear Steven yell down the stairs, "What the hell was that?! Is everyone okay?"
*Short conversation ensues, then after a while... :*
After a short time, you hear the door to the brewery open once more and the now-familiar footsteps of Strog Thunderblade thud across the ground above you.

"What the fuck happened here?"
```


## Characters
**[[Ti|Ti Bronsson]]**: Save his father.

**[[Resolute|Resolute Du'Coreiseuse]]**: Recover the whetstone.

## Log

At the end of this session, [[Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse]] approached Ti and outstretched his arm to take the soul prism, and at the last second, Ti pocketed the Soul prism and casted Twinned Tasha's Mind Whip at Aadhan forcing him to roll multiple times. He failed on the second one. Resolute Misty Stepped over to where Ti's father is and is going to attempt to cast dispel magic on Ti's father to free him from his bonds.

## Reflection

The party decided that they would stay at Northfurrow's End with [[Naxene Drathkala]] and [[The Boy]] in order to watch over them while they rested. However, during the night, [[Oren Yogilvy]], the bard of Northfurrow's End came barging into the Inn claiming the city was under attack by giants. Upon gathering yourselves, you made your way outside to find the town in the midst of a raid, and you worked together to clear the area in front of the inn by dealing with many goblins, several bugbears, and a couple ogres, although you can hear that fighting continues throughout the Walled-Temple-City. Near the end of your encounter, The [[Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse|Shadowy Figure]] that has been tormenting you all appeared before Ti and demanded that the trade happen immediately during the scuffle, hoping to catch you all off-guard and unable to pull anything clever. Resolute, mid-transormation into his holy form, and Ti channeling his divine energy exchanged a gaze and Ti feigned to give the [[Soul Prism]] to the man. In an instant, Ti pulled the gem away and casted a twinned mind-whip spell. Simultaneously, Resolute used Misty Step to appear next to Ti's Father in the hopes of dispelling the magic that holds him aloft against his will and escaping.
