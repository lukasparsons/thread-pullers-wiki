# Charred Notes

## Description:

These notes were found in the cellar after [[The Boy]] was discovered.

It reads:
```ad-info


~~All followers of the Chain Breaker must assist in~~ collecting the vestiges ~~of power. Then we will~~ have our lord's favor.
~~Using~~ the boy, ~~we will restore~~ **Bar** ~~uda in Goldenfields, and he will join us on our quest.~~ ceremony
Vestiges:
~~Raven's Timepiece~~
Whetstone of Helm
~~Ti's item~~ - Scouts found a tomb as well as ~~the homestead of the family who lives there. They may provide answers.~~
~~Haffyd's Item~~
~~Adonis' Item?~~
If we cannot find what we seek ~~at the tomb which is our newest lead~~, pay a visit ~~to the owners of the farm.~~


```

```ad-note

Additionally, there is a page torn from some old tome.
It is some sort of magical script written in infernal. Only a DC 20 Arcana check or taking it to a wizard will be able to tell them more.
```
