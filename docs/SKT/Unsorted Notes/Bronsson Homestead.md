# Bronsson Homestead

###### Flavor Text: 
*This warm abode stands alone in an open field 50 or so feet from the dirt road that runs in front of it. From the porch you can hear the sound of the trickling creek bed afar off. Inside, it always seems to smell of freshly steeped tea and baked bread. The home is originally a two story home with a few bedrooms upstairs, but has since been built onto on either side and behind the house using crafty if unofficial construction methods in order to support the family that seems to be ever growing within its walls.*

## Notes:

### Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse Attacks the Bronssons
[[Session 11]] - [[Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse]] stormed the homestead in search of a [[Bronsson Artifact]] that he believed the family to have hidden away somewhere. After not being able to find such an artifact, he took Ti's father, [[Piotyr Bronsson]] as a hostage to try and extract more information from him.
During a telepathic communication with [[Ti]], Piotyr lost a pinky on his right hand before the two agreed to meet at a later date in order to exchange the [[Soul Prism]] for Piotyr's freedom.
