## Details
### Roleplay Notes
- Both brothers are very jovial and playful, with Steven being slightly more serious than his brother at times.
- They recently acquired the [[Bronzewing Brewery|Goldengulp Brewery]] for a steal after the previous owner [[Walton Barley]] was suspected of witchcraft and supposedly fled [[Goldenfields]] under cover of night.
### Secrets
- The boys told their father, [[Piotyr Bronsson]], that the money he had given them was enough to purchase the rights to the brewery outright, but in reality it was barely enough to become majority owners off of a loan, and they are paying most of what they make from the brewery back to the city to pay the debt.

### Goals
- To make [[Bronzewing Brewery]] a household name and brew the best beer in Faerun.
- Improve their Bronzewing Beer until it is better than Goldengulp ever was.
- Clear out any leftover sign of dark magics or witchcraft that was performed in their new establishment.
- Make their parents proud.
### Flaws
- They don't have much business sense.
- They struggle to take things seriously.
- They are in deep debt to the city of [[Goldenfields]].
## Friends and Foes
