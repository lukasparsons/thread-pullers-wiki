###### Flavor Text: 
*Conflicting smells impact your nostrils as you step into this establishment. The smells of burning incense clash with the many tinctures and salves that line the walls. It is very dimly lit in the room and it seem fairly small but as your eyes adjust you are able to see row after row of freestanding shelves overflowing with boxes with lids that are closed. You don't browse for items here, you tell [[Miss Harriet Baldun]] what you need, and she will find something for you.*

#### Person In Charge:

[comment]: # (Person in charge of the Site. The boss.)
[[Miss Harriet Baldun]]
### Quick Notes:
- Old human lady (in her 60s) who thinks she hold many secret tinctures and relics.
- Most of her items are fake and she has been taken advantage of by traveling merchants who have heard rumor of her gullability and sell her junk claiming it is a rare item or treasure.

##### Employees:

### Wares
---
- Hair Regrowth Oil
- Small Stash of Diamonds
- Spell Components
- Wand of Jubilee
	- `DC 10` Charisma saving throw or dance for one minute.

## Notes:
[[Naxene Drathkala]] gave Harriet the [[Circlet of Souls]] to sell because she was always fond of the woman for providing her with spell components for such reasonable prices, and also to prevent herself from being tempted to use the circlet's power herself.
