# Order of the Sun Soul
## Description
Monks of the Sun Soul Order believe that they each harbor a small fragment of the sun's divine essence, long absent from the Realms. Brothers and sisters of the Order of the Sun Soul are trained to tap into the "spiritual light" within -- a tradition that developed during Amaunator's slow decline -- and manifest it externally. The monks are loosely affiliated with the faiths of Lathander, Sel√ªne, and Sune, and they share many common concerns with those churches. Staunch opponents of darkness, evil, and chaos, the Sun Soul monks serve as crusaders against churches of evil deities, defenders of the common folk, and protectors of sites sacred to deities of light and good.
## Core Beliefs
1. They each obtain a small fragment of the sun's divine essence.
2. Seek out darkness and shine the sun's light upon it, exposing it for what it truly is.
3. Share the sun's warmth by giving, protecting, and healing those who cannot do so for themselves.
## Goals
To spread the warmth of the sun throughout Faerun, protecting those who cannot protect themselves and rooting out corruption wherever they find it.
