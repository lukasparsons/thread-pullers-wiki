# Circlet of Souls

## Description:
```ad-note
A silver circlet the diameter of the average human arm with barely-visable and tiny runic engravings along the inside of the winding armband. There is a spiraling bit of silver on one side that looks like it should hold some sort of adornment.
The Circlet is worn around the arm. When worn, the gem inside breathes slowly creating dim light within 5 feet of the wearer every few seconds before fading agin. This effect cannot be disabled.

The Circlet of Souls is a magical item created by [[Cassander Yvonnette]] with the help of [[Naxene Drathkala]] several years before the adventure begins. When the **Soul Prism** is attached, the wearer is provided certain powers.
```
## Effect:
```ad-info

- Wearing the circlet gives you the same effect as a [Cloak of Displacement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/cloak-of-displacement)
- Killing a creature that arguably possesses a "soul" will increase the natural lifespan of the wielder by 1 year.
- Once per long rest, the wielder can force an enemy that they see within 30 ft. to re-roll an attack or saving throw after hearing the result of the roll.

The following begins to occur as the wielder continues to slay foes.

| Foes Slain | Effect                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | Can hear the voice of [[Baruda]]                                                                                                                                           |
| 5          | Physical bodily manifestation of the devil's power. (smal horns, astral self mod)                                                                                          |
| 10         | Once per long rest, expend a charge instead of spending a ki point. The demon can now speak to creatures telepathically within 20 ft. of you.                              | 
| 20         | Every morning, you make a `DC 15 Constitution` saving throw. On a fail, [[Baruda]] can take control of the host body for `1d10 + 10` minutes.                              |
| 25         | The above effect but for `1d4 hours`.                                                                                                                                      |
| 50         | Your attacks are `+3` against creatures with neutral or good alignment. The above affect also happens for `1d4` days on a failed save.                                     |
| 100        | [[Baruda]] can take control whenever they want for up to `1d4` days. Fully posessing the wearer. Can occur after 1 full day of the wearer regaining control of their body. |

While posessed, your hit die becomes the next higher die. Ie, if your hit die is a d6 for attacks, it becomes a d8 and so on with a max of a d12 hit die. (Idea, not solid).

You cannot unattune from this item without the assistance of a Greater Restoration Spell. Once unattuned, the creature will begin to age normally from the age they appeared to be when they removed the circlet.
