## Recap
![[Session 13#^reflection]]
### Strong Start
```ad-info

Ti, as you feel this pulse of divine energy shoot out from you and you see one of the tails around you whip out and strike the shadowy figure on the head, you see he seems momentarily dazed before he groans in frustration as he seems to be moving more slowly for the time being. Resolute, your held action of Misty Step activates at this moment, and you find yourself apparating right next to Ti's Father who is still floating slightly off the ground bound and gagged. What do you do?

Initiative was Ti > Shadow Man > Resolute > Rest of Party
Ti used mind whip, Resolute used held action to teleport, and now it is the Shadowy Figure's turn.

```
```ad-note
Mind whip only lasts for one turn. Aadhan will use his action to cast [banishment](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/banishment) on Ti's father, stalling for the turn he needs to regain his abilities.

```
```ad-warning
After one round during the new development with Ti's father: You perceive that the invading forces are now retreating and fleeing to the walls, with the errant goblin or bugbear running near the square the players find themselves in, the NPC's begin to chase them off, leaving the party alone. However, while the majority of the invading force is retreating, your eyes are torn up towards the wall where the invaders first entered, and you see two hill giants clumsily climbing over the wall in spite of the retreat of their comrades.

## Log


## Reflection

Ti lashed out with his divine Mind Whip and stunned the shadowed figure and left him in  a daze. Resolute Misty-Stepped over to Ti's Father in the hopes of dispelling the magic that kept him bound against his will. Recoiling from the divine energy spilling into his mind, the shadowy figure mustered the fury and strength necessary to cast one spell in the direction of Ti's father and banish him to a demi plane while he attempted to deal with the lot of you. During the fight, the old cleric appeared that had been seen accompanying the mysterious figure on his endeavors, he bode the figure to come with him. Adonis and Nethhala attempted to distract this dark cleric as Haffyd charged in to assist Ti and Resolute in dealing with the Dark-Durandal-weilding threat. Resolute cast Compelled Duel, a spell that the assailant was all too willing to fail his save for as he was eager to square up against Resolute. Words of resentment and scorn bellowed from the figures lips as he issued and receieved devastating blow after blow. Eventually, Haffyd, finding the seams in the black pauldrons that rested upon the figure's shoulders, brought his blade down with speed, precision, and power, literally disarming your foe. As the figure fell to the ground and the shadows around him began to slip away, the man was revealed to be Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse, cousin of Resolute, Son of Waylan the Holy Smith of Helm. Before he fell limp and the shadows began reclaiming his body, he looked to Resolute and whispered, "Don't tell Father."
The cleric, seemingly put-out and inconvenienced by the development, ported himself away to an unknown location.
The threat not being done, the party split up, with some heading to deal with the hill giants who had climbed over the wall to the south and others heading to Harvesthome Abbey, to see Abbot Ellardin Darovik in hopes of receiving some healing in order to continue their defense of Goldenfields.
The hill giants proved to be less of a threat than you worried at first, due to your strategic thinking, clever illusions, and daring aerial maneuvers. After a brief scuffle, where one of the giants was brought near death and fell to the ground begging for his life, the party decided to let them leave, stumbling into the hills trying to find the rest of their war party and make their way back to their home.
