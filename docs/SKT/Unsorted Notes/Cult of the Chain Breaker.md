# Cult of the Chain Breaker
## Description
The fact that this cult is actually an off-shoot of the Church of Cyric is known only to those highest up in the cult's ranks. Led by a cleric of [[Cyric]] named [[Maokai]], the goal of this cult is to corrupt those who have the potential to be forces for good in the world and turn them against their previous believes and transform them into agents of chaos to wreak havoc across Faerun.
## Core Beliefs
1. If it can be corrupted, it wasn't truly special in the first place.
2. Betrayal is the greatest form of worship.
3. Anything in order should be brought under the natural rule of Chaos through trickery, deceit, and betrayal.
## Goals
Turn those who have a potential for positive change in the world and corrupt them into agents of chaos.
