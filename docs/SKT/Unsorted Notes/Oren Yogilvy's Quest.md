# Oren Yogilvy's Quest
## Description
```ad-abstract
```
[[Oren Yogilvy | Oren]] is spooked by rumors that giants are rampaging throughout the North. He asks the characters if they could check on his sister, Lily, who works at the [[Happy Cow]] tavern in [[Daggerford]]. He also wants them to deliver a hastily written letter to Lily that tells her he’s doing fine, and would she please send him some more money.

Lily (LG female strongheart halfling [commoner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/commoner)) married into the [[Hardcheese Family | Hardcheese]] family, which owns and operates the [[Happy Cow]] tavern in [[Daggerford]]. The real family business, however, is moneylending. The halflings use the tavern to attract new clients, and while the Happy Cow breaks even, it’s not a big moneymaker, and right now the Hardcheese moneylending business is on the ropes. [[Zhentarim | The Black Network]] has agents in Daggerford handing out interest-free loans (but breaking the arms of anyone who fails to pay up); the Hardcheeses simply can’t compete.

If the characters deliver Oren’s letter to Lily, her husband [[Koggin Hardcheese]] (LG male strongheart halfling [commoner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/commoner)) asks them to speak with [[Nelkin Danniker | Nelkin "the Snail" Danniker]], a [[Zhentarim]] operative who is staying at the [[River Shining Tavern and Inn]], and kindly tell him to back off. Koggin would do it himself, but he thinks that the adventurers stand a better chance of persuading the Snail to relent. Nelkin is described in the “[[Daggerford]]” section in chapter 3. If the characters agree to his terms, as outlined in that section, Nelkin will stop undermining the Hardcheeses’ moneylending business.
## Treasure
```ad-note

```

Oren gives the party a cask of Goldengulp (worth 15 gp) as a gift before they leave [[Goldenfields]].

[[Koggin Hardcheese]] gives the characters a cornucopia stuffed with fresh fruit and bread if they come to terms with the Snail. If the characters are visibly unhappy with this reward, he throws in a bottle of winterberry wine (worth 10 gp)
