# Dirt's Dirt

###### Flavor Text: 
*This one-room is barely large enough to hold your group in front of the counter that faces out towards the door. Behind the counter are jars full of dirt. The posts between shelves are lined with nails upon which sacks weighed down with an unknown substance wait to be purchased.*
