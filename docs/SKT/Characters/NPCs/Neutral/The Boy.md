## Notes
When the boy is found, he speaks only in bursts of infernal and slowly relearns how to speak in common one word at a time. He has been living in the cellar drinking from puddles of water that are caused by cracks in the mortar that lead down to the damp cellar.
Timothy is the descendant of a Lord of Waterdeep, [[Thassius Denovan]], who defeated a great devil who was terrorizing the commoners of Waterdeep by giving them horrible dreams that drove them mad and to commit murder. With [[Baruda]]'s final breaths on the material plane, he cursed the family line, leaving his mark on the Denovan bloodline claiming that he would take his descendants as his own. However, becuase his father is actually the wizard known as [[Cassander Yvonnette]], the bloodline is broken. The [[Cult of Cyric]] were not aware of this detail, so when they kidnapped the boy the same night that they stormed the Waterdeep Vaults, and fled to Goldenfields to perform the ceremony to place the sould of Baruda within the boy, it backfired part-way through and they assumed the boy dead and left taking the [[Soul Prism]] with them.
This process left a shard of Baruda's soul within the boy giving him power and influencing his personality.
