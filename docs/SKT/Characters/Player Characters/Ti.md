## Notes

12-02-2021: In [[Session 11]], Ti had a scuffle with Nethhala after he stood on a counter to clear out the Bronzewing Brewery before exploring the cellar. Resolute had already begun calmly going to each table and informing the patrons that they will be closing for maintenance. **Note:** Reflect on how this could have been avoided and steps we can take to avoid this in the future. (see [[Ti's Outburst]])
