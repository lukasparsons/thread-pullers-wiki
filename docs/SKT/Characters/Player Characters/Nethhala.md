## Background
Ancestors were nomadic desert society in the [[Sharr Desert]] that were driven out of their ancestral desert by [[The Great Betrayal]] and moved them towards the snowy mountains. Over time in their new climage, the skin color over the generations changed from the normal tiefling Reds to Browns, blacks, tans and eventually blues/ purples/whites/greys now with the occasional original skin-color. [[The Sarhiri Syndicate]] is the long line of Yakuza bosses that ran [[Caer-Konig]] behind the scenes. Several generations ago, the leader of the Syndicate fell for Nethhala's matron ancestor and began their bloodline. Ever since then, every generation of the Syndicate has been run by a tiefling. The Sarhiri Syndicate used to just be known as "The Syndicate", but when the Sarhiri's moved in and changed their name and became the defacto leaders, they changed the name to match.

Nethhala is the youngest of 8 children, with 7 older brothers. The Seven sons look mostly human with some tiefling traits, However, Nethhala's tiefling blood is dominant making her look like a standard tiefling with blue skin. The eldest 5 brothers do most of the work for their father in running the town, but the younger siblings don't have much to do, spending their days running the library and tinkering in their workshop.

Nethhala does whatever she finds intersting, looking for fun and creating adventures in her head as they have an overactive imagination. She gets little attention from anyone but their father and the 2nd and 7th sons check in on her occasionally.

One day she was out exploring and was caught in a freak blizzard that led her to a cave where she met the [[Prince of Frost]] and struck her pact. He wishes for her to retrieve [[The Raven's Timepiece]] so that he accomplish his goals. However Nethhala doesn't know that after she left, the youngest son came looking for her and also found the prince, leading to him also striking a deal with the Prince as a backup and also the Prince is obsessed with the idea of betrayal.

## Notes

12-02-2021: Sarah has a tendency to steal [[Player Agency]] and carry out her will with physical force of her character. This leads to uncomfortable situations like [[Ti's Outburst]] after he was pulled from the bartop in the brewery.
