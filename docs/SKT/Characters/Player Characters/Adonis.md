He witnessed his mother wither away from a plague that ravaged his village as a boy and was enamored by the elven healer that visited the village in order to tend to the sick from the Church of Lathander, specifically the [[Sun Soul Monastery]] in Waterdeep. Monk from this church are typically Sun Soul monks as they are members of the Order of the Sun. 
 
 However, Adonis has no specific loyalty to Lathander or the Order outside of his desire to learn how to extend his own lifespan. Watching his mother die of plague inspired him to look for any method far an wide to extend his own lifespan and protect himself from a similar fate.

## Notes

12-02-2021
Adonis had a vision from the [[Soul Prism]] in [[Session 11]], where [[Baruda]] offered his help in Adonis' quest to extend his lifespan, however, when the [[Circlet of Souls]] was found and purchased in Goldenfields, the [[Party]] immediately grew suspicious after believing the Soul Prism would easily fit inside the Circlet. May need to figure out some other way for Adonis to get his hands on the two items? Or give up on the idea until they meet up with the wizard responsible for them.
