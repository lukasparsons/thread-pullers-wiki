# Session 1: Nightstone - Arrival
When the party awakens, they find that two of the companions they had made the day prior (the human ranger and the elven druid) are gone along with their belongings, but the other three remaining acquaintances decide to continue on together to Nightstone.

As the group approached the town, they heard the incessant sound of the church bell tolling. Aside from this sound, the town seemed abandoned. Upon further investigation as the bell tolled, the players found that two worgs were devouring the carcass of some ill-fated creature across the town square. After dealing with them, the group realized that a band of goblins had invaded the town and no townsfolk were anywhere to be found.
Additionally, it was clear that some sort of terrible event had transpired as there were giant stones 5 to 10 feet in diameter strewn throughout the village that seemed to have harshly impacted the surrounding earth and structures leaving large holes in buildings, a bridge to collapse, and much more damage.

They entered the church where they found two goblins taking turns anchoring the bell back and forth causing it to ring, laughing hysterically. After dealing with those two, the players met a small goblin by the name of Pojo informed the group that the villagers were in a set of caves to the north of the village being kept prisoner by their boss Hark. About this time the characters see a small, green flying serpent leave a window in the inn and decide to investigate.

Inside the inn, the characters stumble upon a figure hiding in one of the rooms upstairs. At first they pretend to be a traveling monk, but Adonis, a monk himself, is quickly able to see through this ruse. Seeing that she is outnumbered, the individual introduces themselves as Kella Darkhope and informs the group that she is a member of the Zhentarim and her goal is to help her organization gain a position of influence in the town. After further conversation the group decided that it would be best to lay low  as the sun was beginning to set. Making their way to the church, they board up the doors and settle in for the night.
