# Session 12: The Boy
After discovering The Boy, you all attempted to communicate with him. Through his spouts of infernal, the boy was barely able to speak a word in common. 

Strog Thunderblade, Captain of the Guard in Goldenfields, came to investigate why he had begun to smell smoke from his office located in the Dragon's Spire which is connected to the back of the brewery. With a Natural 20 on his insight check, he was not dissuaded from investigating the source of the disturbance, but with Ti's high persuasion role he did not think you all hostile as much as that you were just messing around and worried about getting in trouble. 

Upon seeing the boy, and not wanting to get involved, Strog pointed you in the direction of Naxene Drathkala, resident mage of Goldenfields and a member of the Watchful Order. After bringing her back to the brewery to see the boy, she immediately recognized the boy as Timothy Denovan, a Waterdhavian noble. 

After you shared with her that you had the Soul Prism and Circlet, she recognized the Prism as being something she had made with her old friend and colleague Cassander Yvonnette. (Note, the circlet was not something that she made with him but was housing the Prism when he brought it back to her.) 

Additionally, you learned the legend of the devil Baruda, and based on the note found in the cellar, believe he may be the entity contained within the Prism.  
Once you exchanged all information, her working theory was that the boy had been the subject of a Soul Transferrance Spell that had failed with the boy and whatever is within the Soul Prism being the targets.

You exchanged thoughts and theories over the best way to deal with the Prism as she was charged with destroying it, but it is the only thing keeping Ti's father alive. You agreed to deal with it later and perhaps discuss traveling to Waterdeep together to deliver the boy back to his family and seek help of more powerful mages in curing the boy of his affliction.
