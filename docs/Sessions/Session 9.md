# Session 9: Fog of Undeath

The party treks forward into the land marked on the map by Ti's father Piotyr. They encountered a heavy fog that settled on the rolling hills and surrounding fields. Pushing forward, they found themselves at the entrance of a field of grain that was enveloped in the fog and decided to delve inside.

You discovered the remains of some farmers around an ethereal, purple arcane circle that floated just above the ground. You were attacked by a Zombie horde and a ghoul that seemed to be empowered by the magic circle in the middle of the field.

Once the zombies were all slain, the circle faded away and the party continued forward, reaching a forest that the fog could not penetrate. The fox spirit led you to a hill with a gigantic oak tree growing out of the top of it. 

At the base of the hill were two trees that grew together above an entry into the hillside. It seemed to be a crypt that held the patriarch of Ti's family.

Once inside, you found [[The Shadowy Figure]], that had warned you to abandon your current quest. He closed a tome that he had been reading and tossed it on top of one of the beautiful stone-carved coffins that sat at the far end of the chamber. 

He abandoned two of his followers who fall to the ground and meld into a grotesque monster of flesh. Multiple purple circles similar to what you saw in the fields leading here appeared around you in the chamber. The coffins around you began to rattle as skeletal hands rose up and pulled their fleshless bodies out of their resting places.
