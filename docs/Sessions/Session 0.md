# Session Zero: Trickity's Traveling Troop of Wonders
A traveling circus has set up on the side of the High Road south of Waterdeep where the path splits and heads inland towards Nightstone in the hopes of catching the attention of traveling merchants and the Villagers of Nightstone.

Ti Bronsson, a humble young half-elf with a dash of divine blessing has been traveling with the troop for a short period of time. Paying for his food and lodging by playing in the ensemble during the festivities.

Resolute Du'Coreiseuse, a paladin of helm has begun his journey of raising money for the Church of Helm and is spreading the good news of Helm's watch to those who would listen and collecting alms for the furtherance of the faith.

Adonis Jahran is a traveling monk who is heading south along the High Road, making his way to Nightstone to investigate the strange monolith in the center of the village from which it gains its name.

Lycaon Ascelin and Astrid, a human ranger and an elven druid respectively are currently on the run and fleeing west from the forest when they exit the tree line and stumble upon the wonderous camp.

During the show, a bear that was being forced to perform before it was properly trained broke out of its restraints and began to rampage, gravely wounding Trickity himself. A young girl by the name of Mox Swinton was singing balanced atop a tower of gnomes during the performance and began to fall. The group of adventurers were able to band together to settle the beast and save the girl from falling to her death. Ti after speaking to Earl Greyspine, the animal trainer, learned that Earl didn't want to send the Bear out to perform as she wasn't ready yet, but Trickity ordered it to be done.

Ti confronted Trickity and informed him how lucky he was to be alive let-alone continuing to operate the business and implied there would be consequences for continued mistreatment of animals. Meanwhile the rest of the group found and released the bear and her two cubs and the group released them into the forest, deciding to camp out together a short distance away from the great tent in the direction of Nightstone.
