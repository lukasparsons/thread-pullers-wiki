# Session 4: The Dripping Caves

The party makes their way to the dripping caves, encountering a couple new companions along the way, a dragonborn named Haffyd, and a Tiefling named Nethhala agree to assist the party in their goal of rescuing the villagers of Nightstone.

Upon entering the caves you were attacked by a mated pair of gres that had befriended the goblins as well as the goblins that were watching the main entrance.

One of the goblins retreated to the entrance to one of the chambers and tried to convince you not to enter as there was "nothing of value in there".

After dealing with a bat swarm that had taken shelter in one of the chambers, you found the surviving villagers cowering in the alcoves of the chamber.
Morak Ur'gray, proprietor of the inn in Nightstone and speaking on behalf of the villagers, helped get everyone gathered up and together you made your way back into the main chamber of the cave.
