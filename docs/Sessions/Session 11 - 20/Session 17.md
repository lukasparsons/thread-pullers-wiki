# Session 17: The Noble's Nameday
## Session Summary

After making your way to Amphail, you met up with Arleosa Stonehenge within the Stag-Horned Flagon while several of your companions waited outside the town limits. Resolute and Adonis proceeded within to talk with Arleosa.  

While outside, the rest of the party was approached by one Lord Terrence Ammakyl and verbally accosted for their appearance and mixed races. Ti threw an eldritch blast, startling the young Lord's horse, prompting Lord Ammakyl to threaten that he better not see Ti's face inside the town. The young Lord then made his way to the Stag-Horned Flagon where Resolute and Adonis were speaking with Arleosa when Ti snuck in and began to play music within the tavern.  

This prompted Ammakyl to confront Ti and escalate the situation by cutting the strings on his lute. Things were taken outside the gates of Amphail and Ti taught young Ammakyl a lesson by casting Fireball and effectively killing the young lord along with his friends and house employees. Using all the power he had within him for the day along with Resolute's help, they managed to resuscitate the fallen men, who promptly left with their bodies scarred from the burns. An investigation into the night's events led by Marcus Derren, the captain of Amphail guard, ended with you all inside a cushy cell. You were able to buy your way out of the situation under the stipulation that you immediately leave the town.
