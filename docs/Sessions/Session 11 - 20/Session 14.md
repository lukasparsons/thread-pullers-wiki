# Session 14: Family Troubles

Ti lashed out with his divine Mind Whip and stunned the shadowed figure and left him in a daze. Simultaneously,  Resolute Misty-Stepped over to Ti's Father in the hopes of dispelling the magic that kept him bound against his will. 

Recoiling from the divine energy spilling into his mind, the shadowy figure mustered the fury and strength necessary to cast one spell in the direction of Ti's father and banish him to a demi plane while he attempted to deal with the lot of you. 

During the fight, the old cleric appeared that had been seen accompanying the mysterious figure on his endeavors, he bode the figure to come with him. Adonis and Nethhala attempted to distract this dark cleric as Haffyd charged in to assist Ti and Resolute in dealing with the Dark-Durandal-wielding threat. 

Resolute cast Compelled Duel, a spell that the assailant was all too willing to fail his save for as he was eager to square up against Resolute. Words of resentment and scorn bellowed from the figures lips as he issued and received devastating blow after blow. Eventually, Haffyd, finding the seams in the black pauldrons that rested upon the figure's shoulders, brought his blade down with speed, precision, and power, literally disarming your foe. 

As the figure fell to the ground and the shadows around him began to slip away, the man was revealed to be [[The Shadowy Figure | Aadhan Du'Coreiseuse]], cousin of Resolute, Son of Waylan the Holy Smith of Helm. Before he fell limp and the shadows began reclaiming his body, he looked to Resolute and whispered, "Don't tell Father." 

The cleric, seemingly put-out and inconvenienced by the development, ported himself away to an unknown location. 

The threat not being done, the party split up, with some heading to deal with the hill giants who had climbed over the wall to the south and others heading to Harvesthome Abbey, to see Abbot Ellardin Darovik in hopes of receiving some healing in order to continue their defense of Goldenfields. 

The hill giants proved to be less of a threat than you worried at first, due to your strategic thinking, clever illusions, and daring aerial maneuvers. After a brief scuffle, where one of the giants was brought near death and fell to the ground begging for his life, the party decided to let them leave, stumbling into the hills trying to find the rest of their war party and make their way back to their home.
