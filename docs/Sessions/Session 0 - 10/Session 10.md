# Session 10: Cleansing the Tomb

The party deftly avoided the magic circles in the tomb while dodging attacks from the deceased Bronsson ancestors, and landed blow after blow against the hideous flesh monster. 

A tumultuous and taxing battle with the creature ensued with the party eventually defeating it and laying the Bronsson family to rest once again. The body of the creature evaporated away and in its place were a small wooden case with intricate carvings which Resolute knew to have previously contained the Whetstone of Helm which he knew was meant to be kept safe at Helm's Hold. Additionally, there is a small red gem that seems to give off some sort of arcane energy. 

After the combat, Ti reads the tome that [[The Shadowy Figure]] left behind, and found it to be a journal belonging to Aabjorn Bronsson, the patriarch of the Bronsson family. Inside it read:

   

*My darling Xilriah, not a day goes by that I don't miss your warmth, your beauty, your wisdom. It has been so difficult without you by my side. I am doing my best to raise the beautiful children you blessed me with. When you gifted me this book to celebrate the conception of our 8th son, I was so excited to fill its pages with our adventures and the long life we would spend together. You were meant to outlive me, and I'm so sorry that my love became the reason for your downfall.*

*When your people sent messengers with gifts for our good news and invited you to a celebration ceremony as is your people's tradition, I was so thankful for the restoration that was occurring between you and your family. I wish I could go back and beg you not to go.*

~~Those cowards. Those fucking animals. How could they~~

*They were against us from the start. I know you gave away everything to be by my side, and they didn't value your sacrifice, but saw it as an affront to their tradition. They feigned acceptance and invited you back into their fold only to stab you in the back and leave you cold at my doorstep.*

*At first, I was thankful they at least brought you back to me, but then I remembered the stories you told me of how when a member of your family died you were meant to be buried next to the largest oak in their forest as is their tradition and ceremony.*

*I thought we were blessed by the gods and chosen by them. But they have forsaken us. I am striking the prophecy from our family history. I've already sold the relic to the highest bidder. They weren't here when we needed them, so why should my descendants follow them blindly? I know you wouldn't approve, but this is the only way I will be able to rest in peace. Knowing my family can live on, free to make their own choices and not counting down the days until a prophecy is fulfilled.*

*The boys are old enough now to tend to the homestead. I spend my days here, with you, making your new home more beautiful. I know it isn't much now, but before my time here is done, this will be a place I will be proud to lay my head with you for eternity. I planted an oak tree atop this mound, and I hope it takes root. I am so much older than when you last saw me my love, and I feel my time running out.*

*I'm sorry I never had the courage to fill this book with more words. I didn't think you would want to hear how difficult things were with you gone. I didn't foresee the bigotry and prejudice that would be thrust upon our children's shoulders, and I have done my best to be here for them, but you were always better with those things, you know.*

*Your children are beautiful and full of life. And they will live lives of joy and peace without the weight of expectation and divine responsibility.*

*I will be with you soon my love, I feel my time is short. I pray that when I see you next, you see me as you did when we were young and in love and not as the old and bitter man I have become,*

*Forever yours,*
*Aabjorn Bronsson*

After this, the fox walked into the center of the room and began to glow and levitate. Apparitions of Aabjorn and Xilriah appeared to Ti and offered to augment the fox's power with their essence. Ti, not wanting to leave the tomb without protection from future invaders, sacrificed a piece of his vitality in the form of his arm, to bless the tomb and maintain the divine warding around the tomb and hopefully prevent the souls at rest there from being disturbed again in the future.

However, upon returning to the Bronsson home for some much needed rest, the party discovered that Ti's father had been kidnapped by the Shadowy Figure while they were dealing with the monstrosity in the tomb. Gwen recounts that the figure along with an old man in dark robes entered the home and demanded to know where "the artifact" was and did't believe Piotyr when he claimed to have no idea what they could be referring to. The two invaders took Piotyr and disappeared into the night.

The party collapsed, exhausted, with plans to take Ti's mother to Goldenfields to reunite with her twin sons and Ti's brothers, Steven and Gah Bronsson.
