# Session 2: The Seven Snakes
The party had attempted to bed down for a long rest within the church; however, during the second watch Adonis noticed that the goblins who had been left behind in the town had discovered the bodies of their companions, as well as the raised bridge and were attempting to lower it to make their escape into the night.

Through clever use of mage hand and a glass vial, Ti was able to distract a couple of the goblins and the party ambushed them as they left their goblin friends to struggle with the heavy turnstile. 

While dealing with the goblins in the center of the town square, you turned around to notice Kella lowering the bridge herself to allow the Seven Snakes, a mercenary group hired by the Zhentarim, to come riding into the town on horseback.

Tensions grew as discussions ensued over the correct course of action to take. Xolkin Alassandar, head of the Snakes, was uninterested in leaving the town to save the villagers as their quarry was the town itself and it was now theirs for the taking.
The party decided to make a trip to Nandar Keep in an attempt to meet with Lady Nandar at the behest of Kella before heading into the caves to the north in the hopes of finding surviving villagers.

Upon your arrival at the town's Keep, you found that Lady Nandar had been killed in the attack and all that remained were the four members of her royal guard: Sydiri, Alara, Torem, and Kaelen.

You learned the details of the attack on Nightstone which had been a horrific affair of large clouds collecting over the city and stones being hurled from the sky, breaking the bridge that connected the Keep to the rest of the town over the river. The villagers, who would typically retreat to the Keep were forced to flee the village and head north in search of shelter, which must be how they came to be prisoners of the goblin tribe in the caves there.

After a scuffle with a flying sword in the late Lady's quarters, you amassed treasures for yourselves and through some conflicting words of persuasion, managed to convince the guards to join you on your quest to save what villagers remain in the caves. 

After this you decided to rest and wait for the evening, with the hopes of approaching the caves under the cover of night.
