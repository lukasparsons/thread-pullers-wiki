# Session 3: The Battle of Nightstone
**During his sleep, Ti experiences a strange dream:**

!!! abstract ""
*Ti, you find yourself swimming in a sea of black. You see yourself, your hands in front of you, but nothing else. Suddenly you are overwhelmed with the feeling of falling, but unlike typical dreams, you do not wake from this sensation. The panic begins to set in as you see a great plain begin to stretch out before you. Lit by what you now realize is a faint starlight above your head. Falling for a hundred, a hundred-fifty, two-hundred feet, the ground fast-approaching, suddenly, you are no longer moving.*

!!! abstract ""
*You see this great plain stretch out what seems to be infinitely in all directions before you. The plain begins to move and twist and it looks like gigantic creatures are crawling beneath it and bending it into interesting shapes and features. The plain begins to bend on the edges outside of your view, and you realize that you are suddenly confronted with a view of the world from a bird’s eye view. You are floating a few hundred feet above Nightstone. You can now make out the landmarks beneath you as they take form under the tectonic shifting of the plain. You look up and the sky begins to swirl and dark black clouds form in the air above you, blocking out most of the night sky.*

*After this, stones the size of houses begin falling from the cloud and destroying the plain beneath you. You brace for their impact but you hear nothing, feel no vibrations. You only see the devastation unfold. You look to the east and see tall slender giants. Their physical size incomprehensible to you they could level towns with a footstep. You see them climbing down from mountains far off in the distance like titanic spiders. You look to the west and off the coast you see a storm the likes of which you’ve never seen with semi-constant lighting strikes slamming into the ocean, and in the darkness beneath them you see more humanoid silhouettes in the shadows of the storm. You look to the north and more gigantic humanoid shapes jumping down from cliff-tops and charging forward. With each step, the grounds beneath them freeze over, and they leave blizzards in their wake. The hills around you begin to move and you realize they aren’t hills at all, but more leviathan-sized creatures, round and grotesque with fat, rolling around on the ground laying waste to forests and towns. Then you see the plain split open beneath you, and the plain is lit up with a glow of fire and magma from the newly created fissure. You look straight down into it and huge glowing red eyes stare back at you from the void, as two gigantic hands reach out and clasp the sides of this canyon with ease and begin to pull itself forward and out from its hiding place.*

!!! abstract ""
*You feel overwhelmed with panic. The giants’ movements begin stirring up all matter of monsters and creatures from their dens and hovels and setting them loose on the world, you find yourself in disbelief at the destruction taking place before you and you know in your soul that there is no way for you to stop it, as a giant winged creature flies overhead and its cry is the only thing you have heard since this terrible dream began.*

!!! abstract ""
*As you feel the helplessness close in around you, you look down and see the spirit, the small fox floating just before your chest. It looks to you, and you feel a sense of purpose and renewed strength. It turns its back to you and becomes a floating ball of divine energy, piercing through the darkness. It is hard to look at now. It shoots off with a flash, it runs to the north into a cliff-side not far from Nightstone, flies out, and begins to zip at faster than lightning speeds from one corner of the continent to another. At one moment you catch it flying straight towards the region where your home is found before stopping momentarily, turning on a dime, and continuing its pattern. Each time the spirit makes a sharp turn, the light grows brighter and brighter. Finally, it flies straight toward the forests that run through the heart of Faerun and it disappears into the dark interior, but you can see the underglow it is providing to the trees flashing about like brilliant torchlight beneath the branches. The light grows and grows in brightness and radiance until you can’t look directly at it anymore. It occupies your perspective and all the other parts of the plain beneath you are bathed in the light. As it consumes the entirety of your vision and you see nothing but blinding white light, you hear a deep growl and a snarl of a tremendous creature, and you snap awake.*

Kella was standing over you with a familiar green, winged serpent wrapped around her shoulders, letting you know that you have company.

An orc tribe, forced into retreat from a previous battle within Ardeep Forest to the north are now looking for shelter and the mostly-abandoned village is ripe for the taking. You fought alongside the Zhentarim and were able to protect Nightstone, killing the injured Orc chief and their shaman, forcing the surviving orcs to flee.

After the battle, Resolute restored the guard, Alara, that had fallen, and noted that many of the fallen orcs had been wearing necklaces made from the ears of elves. 
The party began to discuss what steps they would take next and decided that they needed to save the people of Nightstone from the caves as soon as possible.
