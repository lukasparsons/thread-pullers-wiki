# Session 7: In the Tower of Zephyros
The party boards the tower in the clouds and meets the Cloud Giant Wizard, Zephyros. He informed you of The Ordning and how it has been undone by the god of the giants, Annam the All-Father.
Now that there is no hierarchy within giant society, all the different species of giant are pining for power by attempting to please the All-Father in various ways. 

When chaos broke out between the giants, Zephyros took to the skies in his tower and began liberally using the Contact Other Plane spell and seeking advise from the spirits of other planes as to what he should do next. The main response he had heard was that the best thing he could do to stop chaos from unfolding was to head to the small town of Nightstone and he would meet 5 adventurers there that he would need to assist in reaching their destination.

You decided to head to Goldenfields to inform Miros Xelbrin that his family had been killed in the attack on Nightstone and return the family's tressym, Nyx, to him. 

Zephyros informed you that it will take several days to arrive at Goldenfields as the tower moves very slowly in the sky. While in the tower, you enjoyed bountiful meals created by Zephyros using his magic and slept on giant pillows that he had thrown down from his sleeping quarters in the upper levels of the tower.

On the morning of the third day, several riders on the back of giant vultures arrived at the tower seeking an audience with Zephyros. These were members of the Howling Hatred, sent by their leader Yan-C-Bin, The Prince of Evil Air. They had come to attempt to ally with the wizard giant. 

Zephyros, unsure of how to respond, decided to use his Contact Other Plane spell to seek answers as to what he should do, but the spell backfired and he fell unconscious with a loud *Thud* from the upper floor.

Tensions grew in the main atrium as no one really knew what to do. One of the cultists decided that they were going to fly their vulture to the second floor and check on the giant. Nethhala asked if she could joined him and the cultist quickly refused, informing her that no one rides a giant vulture except *their* rider. Nethhala didn't find this to be acceptable and attempted to jump onto the beast anyway, causing the rider to threaten to drop her over the side of the cloud where she would endure a long fall to her death. Ti cast a  sleep spell, causing Nethhala to lose consciousness and drop off of the vulture before the cultist could follow through with his threat.

However, the cultists were deeply offended by Nethhala's actions and attacked the party. One of the cultists that seemed to be in charge by the name of Amaranth opened a satchel that they were carrying and winds picked up, releasing an invisible stalker into the room that set its sights on Adonis. 

Eventually the party was able to defeat the cultists and Adonis healed from the brink of death due to his battle with the Stalker.
