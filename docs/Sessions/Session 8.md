# Session 8: Bittersweet Reunions

The party is dropped off in the middle of a field by a confused Zephyros. He claims that this *is* golden fields. Clearly still troubled by his failed Contact Other Plane spell, the party cuts their losses as Ti recognizes the area as being farmland that exists somewhere between his childhood home and the city of Goldenfields.

Ti decided to lead the party towards the Bronsson homestead before they made their way to the city of Goldenfields. Along the way the encountered [[The Shadowy Figure]] for the first time. He warned them not to continue on their current path if they valued their lives before vanishing in to the shadows. 

Shaking off this unsettling encounter, the party continued to the homestead and met Ti's father Piotyr and mother Gwen. Piotyr informed Ti of a piece of land that used to belong to the family. Piotyr's Grandfather would complain after having too much to drink about some land that meant "too much to the family" that his father had sold when he was younger.

Armed with this new knowledge, Ti wishes to investigate this land in search of answers to the origin of his powers. The party sets out to the west to the location Piotyr marked on a map for them to begin their investigation.
