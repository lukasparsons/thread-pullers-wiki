# Session 5: Villagers and Visions

You assisted the villagers that were being held in the cave to escape to the forest outside, but learned that Daphne Featherstone, niece of Lady Nandar as well as her lady-in-waiting had been recently taken to Boss Hark's chambers.

You confronted Boss Hark, but being a crafty little goblin, he made his way to Daphne and held his blade to her neck in order to negotiate a truce.

After successfully negotiating the release of Lady Daphne, you all set up camp for the night with the exception of Resolute, all were able to have a restful night's sleep outside the mouth of the dripping caves.

Resolute dreamed of a figure in black wielding a black-bladed Durandal, and slaying members of the Coreiseuse family.
