# Session 13: Attack on Goldenfields
The party decided that they would stay at Northfurrow's End with Naxene Drathkala and The Boy (Timothy Denovan) in order to watch over them while they rested. However, during the night Oren Yogilvy, the bard of Northfurrow's End, came barging into the Inn claiming the city was under attack by giants. 

Upon gathering yourselves, you made your way outside to find the town in the midst of a raid, and you worked together to clear the area in front of the inn by dealing with many goblins, several bugbears, and a couple ogres, although you can hear that fighting continues throughout the Walled-Temple-City. 

Near the end of your encounter, [[The Shadowy Figure]] that has been tormenting you all appeared before Ti and demanded that the trade happen immediately during the scuffle, hoping to catch you all off-guard and unable to pull anything clever. 

Resolute, mid-transformation into his holy form, and Ti channeling his divine energy, exchanged a gaze and Ti feigned to give the Soul Prism to the man. In an instant, Ti pulled the gem away and casted a twinned mind-whip spell. Simultaneously, Resolute used Misty Step to appear next to Ti's Father in the hopes of dispelling the magic that holds him aloft against his will and escaping.
