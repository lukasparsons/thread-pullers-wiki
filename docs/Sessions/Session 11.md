# Session 11: To Goldenfields!

Previously, after purging the Bronsson tomb of the evil that had penetrated its defenses, you made your way back to the Bronsson home, only to find it ransacked with Ti's mother hiding in a secret room under the stairs. You decided to take her to Goldenfields and meet up with Ti's brothers Steven and Gah, the new owners and operators of the recently renamed brewery, "Bronzewing Brewery" (previously "Goldengulp Brewery"). 

After making it to Goldenfields, some shopping was done, and reunions were made. At Steven and Gah's request, you agreed to investigate the strange reports of cries and eerie sounds coming from the cellar that had recently been sealed off as the brothers believed these noises to be echoes of the witchraft that the previous proprieter of the brewery (Walton Barley) was allegedly performing down there.

Upon entering the cellar however, you discovered n addition to the valuable casks of Goldengulp ale, remnants of a ritual circle of some sort scorched into the ground, seemingly confirming the twins' suspicions. 

Out of the corner of his eye, Resolute saw a shadow move from behind a cask to another stack of them in the corner of the cellar. After calling for the rest of the party to come join, Ti, thinking on his feet, decided the best course of action was caution and lit the room ablaze using the fine ale as an accelerant. However, as the flames died down you didn't hear screams of pain or see some evil creature burning, but instead you saw a young boy no older than 10 standing in the flames, unburning, as most of his clothing was reduced to tatters.
